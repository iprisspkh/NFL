msgid "Many of you will pick up this book because you know Bill Thetford by reputation or as a co-scribe of A Course In Miracles. Others may find it simply because you are meant to do so. Because of her close personal relationship with Bill during his years in California, and her clear and eloquent voice, we know of no better person to offer insight into Bill’s life than our good friend Carol Howe."

msgid "My journey (Jerry) with Bill and Carol began in 1978 when she first visited Tiburon in the fall of that year. I was still practicing psychiatry and Bill was new in town. I could tell after the first time all of us were together that he was impressed with her. I was not surprised when he started visiting her in Denver and know that being there was a kind of escape for him. I (Diane) met Carol in 1982 when she was in Tiburon and also recognized that she and Bill had a unique relationship. Little did any of us know at that time all the ways our lives would be intertwined over the years or just where our work would take us."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:41
msgid "This book is not simply a biography, but a body of work that integrates the facts of Bill’s life with Course teachings and the personal reflections of more than thirty friends in a way that creates a unique and meaningful experience for the reader. Bill was a man of opposites and contradictions who did not fall neatly into categories. He was also a very private person and in reading Carol’s account of his life, we discovered many things about him that we did not know despite our close friendship and all the years we spent together. That was a heart-warming experience for us. As those of us who were there in the beginning of ACIM history continue to age, there is a sense of urgency to put our experiences and insights on paper so that others may learn from them. We are grateful Carol has chosen to do so in regard to Bill’s life."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:42
msgid "After reading this book, we found it hard to imagine incorporating so many details about Bill into one document. Carol has accurately expressed the impressions and impact that Bill had on the many of us who loved and appreciated him so deeply. In many ways, it is a love story about Bill and his many friends, from comfortable close associates to casual acquaintances, whose insights and experiences with him are included throughout. It’s also a love story about Bill and the Course and, finally, about Bill and God."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:43
msgid "The offering of this book about Bill’s transformation is a gift for those who choose peace of mind. Many of us feel a need to own our thoughts and attitudes, heal our split minds, and thereby heal the world we see. We take an important step in our journey when we become aware that it’s only our own thoughts that hurt us and offer forgiveness instead. Bill’s story is one of giant steps taken through willingness to forgive. Bill was a partner in the original transcription of A Course In Miracles and a true practitioner of its teachings. One of his favorite phrases was “celestial amnesia” and he suggested we all practice forgetting everything unloving about our past. His continual practice of forgiveness, his kind presence, and wonderful sense of humor all led to his ultimate release."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:44
msgid "Carol’s love for Bill and the Course shines deeply in every line she has written here. With this book, she brings a balanced perspective about his life so others can have a better sense of what motivated him. It is a window into his heart and soul, a gift of love she has created for us all. We feel certain that Bill is blessing her with his wit and smiles wherever she goes, with every Course workshop she teaches, and with every word she has written within this book. We are grateful that you, the reader, have chosen to share in this love as well."

msgid "In a few short years all who knew Bill Thetford personally will have exited the world stage. It would be unconscionable for this first generation of A Course In Miracles students, those who were Bill’s friends, to leave without recording our collective witnessing of his transformation.[1] Humanity expends much time and treasure seeking any scrap of information about the teachers, philosophers, and avatars who have gone before, lighting the path for us throughout all cultures and ages. Bill was such a light."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:48
msgid "Drs. William Thetford and Helen Schucman were professors of medical psychology at Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, eminent in their field and known for their research into personality theory. The preface to A Course In Miracles states that the scribes’ names do not matter and, therefore, are not listed on the cover. True though that may be, as the Course continues to become more widely recognized for the life-changing curriculum it proposes, more people are interested in knowing about these two who considered themselves most unlikely candidates for the job."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:49
msgid "In beginning this project, I originally intended to simply write about my own personal memories and recollections of Bill, perhaps with input from my family and some friends in Denver who also knew and loved him. The writing project took on a life of its own, however, and grew to include recollections from a number of his close friends, as well as input from archival records. In time, even though we are never objective about anyone and see them through our own individual filters, a common view of Bill emerged—and what a picture!"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:50
msgid "In some extant publications on ACIM and from information on the Internet—some incomplete or actually incorrect—Bill’s role often seems marginalized as the typist or as Helen’s helper. In most of these accounts, one does not begin to fathom Bill’s presence, his greatest contribution. As for A Course In Miracles, his gifts were twofold: as Helen’s unwavering partner and co-scribe and as its most dedicated and accomplished practitioner."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:51
msgid "The Course lays out a specific plan to liberate our happiness and peace of mind, and Bill’s commitment to it personified the process of forgiveness. For more than ten years, a number of people had the good fortune of watching a master teacher in the making, as Bill’s ego steadily dissolved and his gracious presence—the same presence that exists in all of us—became ever more radiant and unencumbered. My intention is to pay homage to Bill for the gifts he gave us, to provide a more complete portrayal of his life, and to show how his awakening process can illuminate our own."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:52
msgid "[1]A Course In Miracles is a self-study course in three parts: a text, a workbook, and a manual for teachers. Its basic hypothesis is that we are conditioned from birth to a limited way of perceiving and our “understanding” of life is a product of past conditioning. Practicing the workbook lessons undoes our negative, unhelpful, inaccurate view of people, situations, and events, resulting in a different perception of the world. As Course practice proceeds, the fearful ideas we have learned are systematically replaced with an alternative viewpoint—happier, more spiritual, and all-encompassing. Later lessons are designed to evoke a direct spiritual experience and greater love for self and others."

#: paragraph:53
msgid "And thus are two sons made, and both appear to walk this earth without a meeting place and no encounter. One do you perceive outside yourself, your own beloved son. The other rests within, his Father’s Son, within your brother as he is in you. Their difference does not lie in how they look, nor where they go, nor even what they do. They have a different purpose. It is this that joins them to their like, and separates each from all aspects with a different purpose. The Son of God retains his Father’s will. The son of man perceives an alien will and wishes it were so.[1]"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:54
msgid "And so begins Bill’s tale, like ours, a double story, a parallel story. On the one hand, “our own beloved son,” the ego mind—the sense of a personal self that presumes it is in charge, alone, and always wanting something—develops slowly as we “mature,” striving endlessly for security and recognition. Our initial purpose is to protect and promote this “son,” and Bill certainly did that with complete dedication in his earlier days."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:55
msgid "Simultaneously, however, the eternal spiritual presence, the I AM, is always moving deep within the psyche, knocking at the door of awareness to be acknowledged as what we are at the most fundamental level. Thus, “divine discontent” or “spiritual deprivation,” to use Mother Teresa’s phrase, becomes more pronounced as our worldly goals and our budding spiritual inclinations begin to clash. Consolidating our lives under the guidance of one thought system rather than two and adopting a single purpose of forgiveness allow the discomfort and uncertainty to diminish and finally disappear. Ultimately we awaken and recognize we are forever our “Father’s Son.” As we shall see, by the end of his life, Bill had accomplished this mission."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:56
msgid "Like most people, Bill presumed he was organizing his life according to his personal priorities, but as I assembled the details of his life, it became clear he was being led inexorably, step by step, to his own awakening. His personal story, with its trials and triumphs, waxes, wanes, and finally closes, but not before he demonstrates how to lay aside the quest for the “best of both worlds”—that unsatisfactory mix of love and fear—to pursue the single goal of peace of mind. He also makes it clear that you can be “in the world but not of it” and accomplish the only feat that really matters—waking up."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:57
msgid "Bill was a shy and private man, and all those who knew him are very clear that he would not and did not seek publicity. Once A Course In Miracles became the centerpiece of his life, he always preferred to focus on its teachings and not on his personal life. In any biography about him, he would want the transformation of his personal life to be “exhibit A” of what is possible when one chooses to practice the Course teachings. Therefore, in order for his life to illustrate some of its major principles in action, this biography provides some details about his “time and space” history. His life is representative of everyone’s, and the steps he took reveal those we must take, if we would be healed. This document is less a traditional biography than a guidebook for learning to leave grievances behind, replacing them with grace and peace of mind."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:58
msgid "Of all forms of recognition, Bill most objected to being sanctified or put on a pedestal. In the early days, some ACIM teachers were inclined to do just that. He used to laugh about his response to situations where he thought he had been unduly elevated, saying, “When they started that, I’d just have to smoke cigarettes and say ‘shit’!” Now, he would want people to know his shortcomings and not evade issues he found challenging. Although he insisted on seeing himself as ordinary, most of his friends did not. Therefore, to honor what would certainly be Bill’s request, I present him here as a beloved equal, a dear friend, and unwitting mentor to so many. One wonders if he ever totally realized how greatly he touched others. In discussing this gift with him, in true egalitarian fashion he would ask us to apply that same question to our own lives. And so we should."

#: paragraph:59
msgid "It is, of course, unnecessary to know anything about Bill Thetford and Helen Schucman to benefit from the lessons of A Course In Miracles. Some students are unaware of his existence and others may not be particularly interested. However, many are curious about the daily life, habits, and interests of the two persons who made available one of the world’s most important psychospiritual works. For those who are not curious about the particulars of Bill’s life, there are suggestions throughout this book that can help ease the burdens we often carry and move us toward a happier, more lighthearted experience of life."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:60
msgid "One time years ago, when Bill was at my home in Denver, he indicated that he felt we were to do some work together, but at the time neither of us could imagine what that would be. ACIM was still fairly new, so more writing didn’t seem called for. With his extreme introversion and my general extroversion, a project suitable to our different modes of being in the world seemed a mystery, so we agreed to wait and see what would happen. Years later, in the days after Bill’s passing, I felt the mantle being passed to the next generation, so to speak, and that it was imperative for those of us drawn to the Course to increase our dedication to “walking the talk.” I spent a great deal of time contemplating my experiences with him and presumed the obvious, that our “project,” whatever it might be, would still happen even though we were on different sides of the “veil.”"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:61
msgid "During his ten years in California, the last chapter of his life, Bill often told the stories of his youth, his career path, and the circumstances surrounding the scribing of the Course, almost always with a humorous twist. He used to say he would probably tell those stories until he was finally comfortable with them, as if telling and retelling them was a sort of soul-liberating confession. In particular, he often commented that if we thought studying and practicing the Course was difficult, we should have experienced the complications of scribing it. Therefore, we will read his tales from our current vantage point, which allows a more fleshed-out picture of him. I have also included firsthand accounts of his impact on those who knew him, the healings that occurred for so many, as well as my own experience of a precious friendship with him."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:62
msgid "I have gathered information about Bill before his last ten years from secondhand sources—persons who knew him in his earlier days, archival records, and from Bill’s own writings. In addition to his many academic publications (see Appendix Two), he wrote an autobiographical essay when he was fifteen for a school assignment and an unpublished autobiography, originally created through a series of taped interviews with Frances Vaughan in 1982, now held under copyright by the Foundation for Inner Peace. Although he could report what he did and what was important to him, he could not accurately portray his life as others experienced him. Therefore, those who interacted with him must say what that was like for us because his legacy is too important not to share."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:63
msgid "In addition, as I spoke with old friends who were also some of Bill’s closest companions, we reaped an unexpected dividend. We are coming back together with renewed appreciation for and delight in one another’s friendship and company—and probably a common wish that we all had used tape recorders back then, not realizing the import of what we were witnessing. Now with this book, I hope to honor him, not to put him on that pedestal he abhorred or make him “special,” but to allow him to be helpful still to anyone drawn to his presence. I have to believe Bill, wearing a big smile, is at the heart of this process. His energy was so present during this writing that I believe this is truly our joint project, offered to you with happy memories and many blessings."

#: paragraph:67
msgid "Into eternity, where all is one, there crept a tiny, mad idea, at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh. In his forgetting did the thought become a serious idea, and possible of both accomplishment and real effects. Together, we can laugh them both away, and understand that time cannot intrude upon eternity. It is a joke to think that time can come to circumvent eternity, which means there is no time.[1]"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:68
msgid "If ever there was one who learned to joke about the absurdity of the human condition, it was Bill Thetford. He was graced with a superb sense of humor, delighting in the antics, large and small, of both himself and his fellow human beings. A prayer in the liturgy of the Episcopal Church begins, “Almighty God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid, . . .” Bill was a mortal version of that omniscience; for him his fellow man was deeply transparent, an open book—and often a comic book. His lighthearted touch was his hallmark as he saw the comedy in the ego’s serious postures. He laughed not at people, however, but at our treasured notions, beliefs, and practiced self-deceptions."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:69
msgid "He had his own issues, of course, times that seemed depressing or fraught with difficulty, but sooner or later, his emotional equilibrium would be restored, the twinkle returning to his eye as he told his hilarious stories. When we can laugh at the dramas, the formerly unhappy circumstances in our lives, we know they are healed. With a rigid, humorless approach to any aspect of our lives, we still have work to do. Bill’s droll sense of humor pervaded his life and is the single characteristic I believe he would most want remembered."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:70
msgid "While finishing the interviews for this book, Hugh Prather, best-selling author and one of Bill’s confidants, and I reminisced by phone about the gift he was to us, especially about how witty and funny he could be. One of Bill’s favorite early Course stories, told with kindhearted laughter, was about a gentleman who discovered his address in Manhattan and came knocking on his door. When Bill answered, the man earnestly announced that he was a new ACIM student and that the Holy Spirit told him to find Bill and ask him for $10,000. Without missing a beat, Bill responded that the Holy Spirit had already alerted him to this request and indicated he was not to give it to him. I can still see Bill’s delighted smile as he recounted such entertaining tales about humankind in general and Course-related drama in particular. He often said he thought he should write a book entitled A Course In Miracles Follies about the craziness that occurred while bringing this material into the world, as well as some of the strange ideas and misperceptions that have been perpetuated in its name. To his credit, he found these occurrences amusing rather than alarming, and we would all benefit from emulating his lighthearted approach."

msgstr ""

#: paragraph:72
msgid "I was given a sort of mental “explanation” . . . in the form of a series of related thoughts that crossed my mind in rapid succession and made a reasonably coherent whole. According to this “information,” the world situation was worsening at an alarming pace. People all over the world were being called on to help, and were making their individual contributions as part of an overall, prearranged plan. I had apparently agreed to take down a course in miracles as it would be given me. The Voice was fulfilling its part in the agreement, as I would fulfill mine. I would be using abilities I had developed very long ago, and which I was not really ready to use again. Because of the acute emergency, however, the usual slow, evolutionary process of spiritual development was being bypassed in what might be described as a “celestial speed-up.” I could sense the urgency that lay behind this “explanation,” whatever I might think about its content. The feeling was conveyed to me that time was running out.[2]"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:73
msgid "I remember that phrase, “celestial speed-up,” from my earliest conversations with Bill; it seemed odd but accurate. Now, thirty years later, it is even more so. Our world appears to be increasingly less stable, more complex, the years moving by at an accelerated pace. William (Whit) Whitson, introduced later in this chronology, writes, “Unknowingly, Bill and Helen had forewarned and forearmed America for what Helen believed was the coming social and metaphysical crisis.”[3] Now that crisis seems to be upon us. A Course In Miracles reminds us that we are completely confused about what is valuable and what is not. Our values are upside down and backwards, and we put precious and powerful attention on what doesn’t matter, steadily ignoring what does. We believe our actions and their influence are of great importance, but thoughts are our own private business and, being invisible and silent, do not count for much. Hence we set great store on the externals of our lives—our careers, material possessions, the face we present to the world—while being oblivious to our internal processes. With this in mind, we begin Bill’s story with highlights of his external life: early history, the jobs he held, his overriding interests—those areas that were compelling and fascinating for him. These will serve as the framework for becoming better acquainted with his interior life—his choices, struggles, gifts, and most of all, his loving presence. We shall observe the process as Bill steadily moves forward in releasing his ego—“the block to the awareness of Love’s presence”—just as we must do if we want to be joyous, free, safe, and abundantly cared for.[4]"

msgid "Lest one think Bill’s life was easier or more charmed than others and that living the Course was inherently less challenging for him, his early years come alive via excerpts from an essay entitled “I Live Again,” which he wrote as an English assignment when he was fifteen years old. Of his parents, John Randolph and Edna Mae Thetford, he wrote:"

msgid "Then began an early married life of hard work and sacrifice and of the rearing of three children. John, Jr., the first child, died in infancy after seven days’ struggle for life. A curly haired, beautiful baby girl, Patricia Ann, next entered our busy household three years later. . . . On a bleak April morning [in Chicago, IL] in 1923, . . . the author of this chronicle first saw the light of day. . . . When I look back upon what a strong-tempered little vixen I was, always getting into scrapes, I realize how much extra trouble my behavior caused her [his mother]."

msgid "Patricia was the big dominating force of my early life—outside of Mother. The sun rose and set upon Patsy Ann. I was her constant shadow and continual worshipper. A fostering of an unmanly interest in dolls and tea parties and other effeminate things was the result of my close association with Patsy and her girl friends. In fact, my fascination for the opposite sex has never deserted me."

msgid "The following December after having been quarantined for three weeks with scarlet fever, I arose one morning, only to find my body wracked with rheumatic pains and fever. This led within a few days, to a serious heart ailment. For three whole months I was unable to raise my head off the pillow. During these long months of fighting to live, Mother was my nurse, playmate and teacher. . . . Considering my illness as only a temporary thing, I soon began to plan as to how I would spend my days in the outdoors playing baseball and other games and sports, until I overheard a telephone conversation in which Mother, in whispers, remarked that I would not be able to get out of bed for at least another year and a half.[5]"

#: paragraph:80
msgid "Bill told me he was devastated by that conversation and made a determined choice to live, despite the doctor’s gloomy prognosis, rather than have his parents suffer the loss of all three of their children. Early on, he seemed aware that he had a choice in the matter—quite a challenge for a seven-year-old and revealing of his heightened awareness. In retrospect, Bill recognized that his serious illness, commencing six months after his sister’s passing, was not a coincidence. Those who work with grieving families observe that siblings of children who die often feel guilty that they remain after the brother or sister has gone. Or they worry over the effect of the death on their parents’ stability, and thus on their own welfare, and/or try diligently to deny the loss in their young lives. A Course In Miracles is unequivocal about the role that guilt, fear, and anger play in projecting the dis-ease or dis-harmony within our minds onto the physical body and the role forgiveness plays in restoring both mind and body to health. Hundreds of pages address this topic in no uncertain terms. “Sickness is a decision. It is not a thing that happens to you, quite unsought, which makes you weak and brings you suffering. It is a choice you make, a plan you lay, when for an instant truth arises in your own deluded mind, and all your world appears to totter and prepare to fall. Now are you sick, that truth may go away and threaten your establishments no more.”[6]"

Gradually, however, I became accustomed to the thought and soon it held no terror for me. Constant reading and the kindness of our family friends made the days fly but too quickly. . . . Despite relapses, when I hovered near death’s door, I continued to progress, until after two and a half years of shut-in convalescence, I took my first step outside. My first glimpse of the brilliant blue of the sky, after months of seclusion, caused me to emit a gasp of wonderment. At the time I thought it was the most beautiful sight I had ever seen. I was very unsteady on my feet, and in fact, I had to learn anew how to walk. . . . My rediscovery of the world is the most thrilling and vivid of all my recollections. Being out of circulation had made me very shy and I found it extremely difficult to mix with people.[7]"

#: paragraph:83
msgid "From the beginning, Bill was innately at home in the world of the abstract, and for him this inner world was real, vivid, and as satisfying as if he were physically engaged. He credits “reading and family friends” as causing the time to fly, but that observation is incomplete. He doesn’t mention his rich inner life, taking that for granted and very likely assuming, as we all do in our earlier years, that everyone processes life as we do and that our own approach to circumstances is the norm. That is hardly the case. He wrote this essay before he knew about personality types or had yet realized that not everyone has such readily available intuitive ability. His being socialized to be alone was actually in keeping with his basic tendencies. People today, particularly those with more outgoing temperaments, might find such confinement unimaginable considering there were no TVs, video games, or cell phones for distraction."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:84
msgid "It also seems, from our vantage point, that Bill learned the art of surrender at an early age. His long, solitary stay in bed, with its enforced introspection, facilitated a capacity for acceptance that would have great transfer value to other dimensions of his unfolding life. Just as Helen noted that the urgency of the times required her to practice the art of “inner dictation” sooner than a more leisurely pace of spiritual evolution might allow, it seems that Bill’s nascent spiritual development was also accelerated. His years of quiet seclusion were like being in a monastery, where he could examine such thoughts as “Who am I?” or “What is life’s purpose?” Catherine Prescott, a friend he met many years later, remembers, “Bill described himself as being very slow in reaction time, . . . in his childhood there was always so much time that he would savor each moment; he didn’t have to rush. So that if one little thing happened, he was always slowing time down to make the moment last. I think part of his wisdom was the ability to hesitate and ponder what was going on.”[8]"

He had no idea what he was getting into, believing this would be a support system of some kind.

Thus, after receiving his undergraduate degree in psychology from DePauw in February 1944 and being unable to participate in the military, Bill submitted his application and was accepted into the University of Chicago Medical School for the upcoming fall term. In addition to taking courses necessary for his psychology degree, he had also completed all necessary pre-med classes. Hoping to earn money for his first year of medical school during the intervening six months, Bill applied for work at the University of Chicago. He was hired as one of ten administrative officers overseeing several buildings used as testing areas for some highly classified research. Later, he learned it was research on atomic energy—the Manhattan Project. Soon after being hired, he was promoted to the faculty payroll and given a private office and secretary. “One of my special assignments was to be in charge of a special crew of men,” Bill later wrote, “who went through various radioactive areas and tried to decontaminate them. I was required to wear a Geiger counter from the time I arrived in the morning until I left at night.”[11]"

One testing area for which he was responsible was beneath the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium, made available for research because the university’s president had eliminated intercollegiate football as an interference to academic learning. The first chain reaction in the world took place there in December 1942. The irony was not lost on twenty-year-old Bill. Given the heightened tensions throughout the country and the sense of urgency related to his supposedly interim job, Bill chose to continue on for another year, foregoing medical school that fall. The bombs were dropped on Japan in August 1945, and he resigned shortly thereafter on seeing the horrific results of the project’s success."

Thus, in the fall of 1945, without much thought about where it would lead, he enrolled in the University of Chicago’s graduate school in psychology where the already noted psychologist, Carl Rogers, was beginning to hold forth. Unaware of what people sensed about him, Bill was confused and surprised when Rogers offered him a teaching position almost immediately; he was younger than almost all the other students and did not yet have a master’s degree. He was also the only member of Rogers’s staff not imported from Ohio State University. Soon thereafter, Rogers invited him to participate in research on the merits of his signature “client-centered psychotherapy.” This was an innovative new approach to psychotherapy that emphasized the importance of relationships. Specifically, the Rogerian approach was based on “unconditional positive regard,” or perfect love, and its essential place in the success of client-centered therapy."

Within this framework of emphasis on relationships, however, Bill received his Ph.D. in psychology in the spring of 1949; his research focused on the psycho-physiological changes in galvanic skin response, heart rate, and respiration in clients tested before and after Rogerian psychotherapy, as compared to a control group. Simply stated, his research showed that being loved, appreciated, and listened to positively affects both mind and body. Although now, sixty years later, that is old information, at the time it was revolutionary. Everyone who knew Bill remembers his saying how bizarre it was for him to be involved, even though unknowingly, first with a project that resulted in merciless devastation, and then with one that espoused the practice of “unconditional positive regard.”"

In the foreword, he writes, “But lest the reader waste time upon what he does not want, it must be emphasized that this is not a book on diagnosis or therapy of personality problems, or upon any type of clinical approach. It is simply an attempt at evaluation of data on how personality grows.”[12] It is fortunate for readers that he limited his topic to this single one as, 927 pages later, we have a recap of those major areas of research to which Bill would contribute significantly."

It is quite likely that selfhood will be better understood when reference is made to the primordial non-self matrix from which it arises, and that the synthesis, the capacity of human nature to function at self and non-self levels at the same time, or to alternate when it so desires, may prove to be an enrichment of personality far greater than that which the cult of self-contained, self-defined individuality can grant.[13]"

He had listened to friends’ classical music collections as much as possible during his years at the University of Chicago and fell in love with Mozart. In fact, he was so intimately acquainted with Mozart’s music that after hearing a few bars of a recorded piece, he could accurately identify both the performers and the conductor of that particular recording. As he became more musically sophisticated during this time, his love of opera grew and he realized that a good way to become more familiar with it was to usher at the Chicago Opera House, home to several large opera companies. He was on a tight budget, but after saving enough to buy a tuxedo (required for the position), he did indeed become an usher there. Through attending every performance possible, he developed a deep appreciation for and knowledge of that particular art form."

To put his early years in context, theirs was a lower-middle-class family, the parents knowing no other than hard physical work. His father was one of ten children from a poor, coal-mining family in southern Illinois, though later he became a superintendent in the building and construction department of the telephone company. Survival was important; culture was not. Bill had become ill at age seven during the depths of the Great Depression when life was generally difficult. Having lost two children earlier, his father worried greatly about how he might have to support this ailing child who very likely would never be able to do strenuous physical work. How would he be able to support himself? His father often verbalized his fear that Bill would end up on the “dole,” a welfare case.

A fellow graduate student mentioned to Bill that a position had unexpectedly become available with Dr. Samuel Beck, head of the psychology department and a leading authority on the Rorschach test (a method of psychological evaluation in which subjects’ perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using intuitive insight and/or complex scientifically derived algorithms. This test is used to examine personality characteristics and emotional function). Bill applied and Beck offered him a position to study schizophrenia and the Rorschach test, funded by the National Institute for Mental Health. After Bill explained that he knew nothing about the Rorschach test, Beck assured him he considered that to be an asset, as it would allow him to conduct research uncorrupted by someone else’s teaching. He was also enthusiastic about Bill’s Ph.D. dissertation, thinking it sounded most scientific, a plus. This first position as a doctor of psychology allowed Bill to become acquainted with, among other things, personality tests and measurements, which would prove useful as his career unfolded. Working there also provided the unusual experience of being the only non-Jewish member of the department. He wondered if he would be accepted, a question of possible reverse discrimination, but he certainly was; his fellow staffers even explained their Yiddish jokes to him. After two-and-a-half years, the grant ended and he chose to move on, but where? The University of Chicago and Michael Reese Hospital were the city’s most interesting and challenging places to work, and he had now “been there, done that.”"

He also wasn’t particularly sure, at the outset, what pursuing a degree in psychology was about, but by 1945 he had lost interest in medical school, something of a fantasy anyway given that he hadn’t the funds to pay for it and his family couldn’t help even if they had been inclined. Moving to Michael Reese Hospital had a certain aimless quality about it, from the world’s point of view, but in hindsight his particular destiny was unfolding perfectly.

We know that only after the fact. Even at a young age Bill had demonstrated his ability as an able, trustworthy administrator.

msgid "As the global total cold war gathered momentum, it became clear that the young CIA desperately needed help. An extraordinary network of civilian universities and government agencies had provided OSS with a steady stream of raw intelligence to guide the total war against Nazi Germany and Japan. In contrast, the young CIA in 1947 was treated like a stepchild, its experienced leadership in short supply, its actual and legal authority still unclear. The new CIA needed more than old files from the OSS. Their greatest need was for personnel. During hearings on the National Security Act of 1947, the new director of central intelligence, Allen Dulles, said, “The new intelligence entity would be directed by a relatively small but elite corps of men with a passion for anonymity and a willingness to stick at that particular job. The agency must have a corps of the most competent men, which this country can produce, to evaluate and correlate the intelligence obtained.”[22]"

msgid "The challenge was how to recruit and evaluate this badly needed group of people. At that time, various schools of psychology had been around for about one hundred years; they seemed to hold the keys to human behavior—a must-have for evaluating foreign leaders and how they might respond under different circumstances—and to methods for recruiting those essential intelligence officers. In 1950, the year before Bill was hired, the CIA had offered John Gittinger the position of director of its assessment and evaluation staff. Bill, hired in 1951 as one of about ten senior psychologists at that time, worked for Gittinger in that department and would continue to work indirectly with him throughout much of his academic career. John made a tremendous impression on Bill and became a pivotal player in his life."

msgid "Bill’s duties included administering a series of tests to applicants seeking to become intelligence officers and/or spies, then interviewing and recommending them or not. There was a sense of danger in the air and great urgency about staffing up as the cold war with the Soviet Union escalated and the Korean War progressed. Obviously, in screening potential hires, the psychologists needed insight, intuition, and the ability to read people accurately, all of which were Bill’s strong suits. Because of the sensitive nature of this work—interviewing those who would be working for the Agency in various intelligence capacities—Bill soon attained a top secret security clearance, something that usually took a while to earn. It would serve him later as his worldly saga unfolded."

#: paragraph:140
msgid "Working with the CIA offered Bill, in addition to his position on the assessment and evaluation team, the added opportunity to learn more about Gittinger’s new project to assess people’s capabilities under various conditions, stressful and otherwise. These innovations and their potential importance greatly impressed Bill, providing the next chapter of his series of psychological explorations. Gittinger had developed a process, originally to describe the dynamics and adjustments of mental dysfunction, but later widely used as a technique for general psychological assessment. He reportedly was very charismatic and loved to talk for hours about his theories. An early colleague of Bill’s reported, “You couldn’t ignore John; he was there, he filled up a room. He was a pied-piper, guru-type, interesting individual who developed a theory in terms of how people progressed through life. I know Bill was intrigued and would often sit and listen to John expound his theories.”[23]"

#: paragraph:141
msgid "During his first year with the CIA, Gittinger continued work on his model of personality development, newly named the Personality Assessment System, or PAS. For more than two decades, John and others, including Bill, continued to refine what eventually Bill considered the most powerful and efficient descriptive and predictive personality assessment system in the world, deserving to be ranked with Freud and Jung’s discoveries. Leaders in intelligence circles wholeheartedly agreed with this assessment."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:142
msgid "At that time [1961] CIA psychologists began to substitute such direct evidence as body language and overt behavior for the one-hour test to assess personality. However, the PAS remained the conceptual structure that guided any such assessment from direct observation. Using the PAS to analyze and make accurate predictions about key world leaders, Gittinger advised several presidents until his retirement in 1978. As early as the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, he conferred with President Kennedy about the likely behavior of Nikolai Khrushchev under stress. The astonishing accuracy of the PAS eventually won for Gittinger promotion to the role of Chief Psychologist of CIA for World Wide Operations.[24]"

It seemed to have some special appeal to him, as he became more animated when he spoke of it. I knew nothing about the CIA’s early history at that point and couldn’t fully appreciate the scope of the work and Bill’s major contributions to refining that assessment tool, but I did recognize his enthusiasm. Even as a young man, when it came to understanding human behavior, Bill was already in the vanguard and Gittinger recognized that talent. As David Goodrich, a colleague of Bill’s, reported:"

#: paragraph:144
msgid "John was not a doctor of psychology; he had a master’s degree in counseling. That’s not a big deal but I think it was to John, so someone with Bill’s credentials was very attractive to him. And, obviously, he held a most favorable opinion of him. Everyone who ever worked with Bill realized he was an extremely bright guy. John considered Bill one of his real protégés. Basically, John was a very human guy, always somewhat overweight, and as part of his theory, he believed that people were born with or soon acquired something that either made them attractive or unattractive to people. He believed the world treated the cute baby or the attractive little child very differently, allowing them to develop a totally different perspective than people like John believed himself to be. A great deal of John’s thinking was that those unattractive people had to compensate. That was his own self-account. John was motivated by a sincere desire to be helpful to the Agency and he was. He also had a huge investment in this theory and had at least as much ego as the rest of us, if not more.[25]"

#: paragraph:145
msgid "The purpose of the PAS is to predict a person’s future behavior so that the responding behavior can be appropriate in relation to it. Where you cannot give the test directly—as for instance, to a foreign leader—it is important to have ways to determine the personality that underlies observable behavior, thus making it possible to predict that person’s future actions. Obviously, greater comprehension of human behavior is very important in many other areas, as well—all types of counseling and psychotherapy, personnel work, classroom assessments, crime detection and prevention, to name a few—and, of course, foreign relations."

At the same time, the system allows objective comparisons among the personality features of different individuals, thereby offering a suitable framework for behavioral research and definitive investigations of personality structure and function.[26]"

#: paragraph:153
msgid "In other words, the PAS is an elaborate system for describing how personality is built from infancy through adolescence and all the compensations required when we reject our innate characteristics and inclinations, when we are not self-accepting. This applies to every person born. A Course In Miracles also speaks with revealing eloquence on the subject, though with a decidedly different slant:"

And be you sure and happy in the confidence that it will go at last, and leave your mind at peace.[28]"

#: paragraph:157
msgid "Working with John Gittinger, Bill was becoming enamored with the PAS, this very sophisticated process of describing how a personality is built and under what conditions. The Myers-Briggs test, excellent and helpful though it is, does not have this level of sophistication. ACIM had not yet been written, although it would have much to say about personality development in years to come. We can already look ahead and compare the foundations on which the PAS is built to those of the Course, and the life-altering decision that lay ahead for Bill."

Realizing that no observation is objective but colored by the mind-set of the observer, I think the correlations between the theory of Bill’s personality (see Appendix One) and this firsthand account are worth noting:"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:159
msgid "An independent but socially involved person, Bill had a high sense of mission. He was typically well organized, systematic, self-disciplined and socially effective, if often aloof. Although he could be intensely individualistic and unconventional, he was rarely revolutionary, preferring to dedicate his practical, pragmatic nature to improving, not dismantling, organizations and procedures. He was very conscious of his own needs, which he usually kept under effective control. He was equally perceptive of the needs of others but was not likely to be dominated by them. As a manager, he was thus concerned but relatively dispassionate, sometimes appearing detached or even unsupportive if others failed to meet his high standards. He was typically ahead of or on top of events, confident of his ability to cope with most situations and able to prepare for those that promised to be challenging. He rarely got caught off guard or over his head.[29]"

#: paragraph:160
msgid "In researching this book, I spoke with three of Bill’s colleagues, then also senior psychologists with the CIA, who indicated that in the early 1950s they recruited only the “brightest and best,” originally graduates from Yale and Harvard but later from other institutions as well. They said it was a very interesting and exciting time, with much innovative work in the assessment area and a great sense of esprit de corps. Feeling part of the inner group, these bright young people entrusted with sensitive, high-priority tasks were always very supportive of one another. Friends conversant with the CIA from its earliest days confirmed the collegial culture there and indicated that many who worked together stayed in touch long after leaving their official employment with the Agency, continuing to support each other and their interests whenever possible. Apparently, one never really retires from the CIA."

#: paragraph:161
msgid "One of his new friends at the Agency described Bill, on first meeting, as very young in appearance (he was twenty-eight), bright-eyed, intelligent, very enthusiastic about his interests, fun to be around, friendly and gregarious, but somewhat restless, as if he had not quite found himself. For all his outward charm, Bill was reticent about revealing himself; he did not discuss his private life or how he felt."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:162
msgid "Despite his youthful enthusiasm, it seemed that Bill was not going to make Washington and the Agency a permanent stop. He spent as many weekends as possible in New York attending the theater, his passion even then, and feeling very much at home in the city. Music and theater were already part of his very soul. Friends remembered him wearing his tight-fitting khaki pants and boots, conveying more the essence of the theatrical world than a government job. One colleague said they often had lunch with a woman, Gertrude, who was also especially interested in the theater; Bill was close to her although she was ten years his senior. With this early draw to New York and its culture, he was not finding or establishing roots in Washington, D.C., despite being dedicated to his work there."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:163
msgid "Bill preferred the company of women to the military or “macho” men who were in the majority at the CIA. That was understandable because by then he had recognized and accepted his homosexuality, which would seem an impossible situation since homosexuals were not allowed in the CIA. Applicants were required to take a polygraph test that should have revealed as much. Bill indicated many years later, however, that his familiarity with biofeedback and various scientific instruments used during his time with Carl Rogers and the completing of his Ph.D. taught him how to make the polygraph machine read “inconclusive,” and he was hired. He made certain his apartment was clear of anything that could give him away, and when it was covertly checked—he had ways to determine if it was—no evidence was there to find."

#: paragraph:164
msgid "David Goodrich described him as a remarkably competent guy, very perceptive, a delightful friend and companion with a great sense of humor—a trait everyone in his life admired and found noteworthy. More than thirty years later they met again, this former colleague having discovered Bill’s involvement with ACIM and now a student of it himself. He had wondered if he would see Bill differently, as an “ascended master” of some kind, but he did not. However, he found the same characteristics Bill had displayed in the 1950s—being very present, very casual, easy to relate to, and intensely sincere—were still in place."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:165
msgid "In 2007 I met with Goodrich and again we discussed their last meeting about a year before Bill’s passing. He pondered over why he had still seen him as a wonderful person but was not struck forcefully, like so many others, by the power of his quiet presence. The Course speaks to this issue, stating that we bring all past associations with us when we observe anything, whether a person, object, or situation. In this man’s case, he was seeing Bill again but not with a clean lens, so to speak, inadvertently bringing his old perceptions of him, positive though they were, to the encounter. ACIM exhorts us to practice viewing everything with new eyes, allowing ourselves to see without the usual interpretations, judgments, biases, and ever-present question, “How can I use this for my benefit?” It promises a sense of well-being and peace when we view anything without our past history laid on it, without the obstacle of accumulated thought. People who met Bill for the first time in his later years, with no expectations, were the ones who found the experience extraordinary and comforting."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:166
msgid "Although the CIA’s promise of discovering exciting new psychological processes was certainly alluring and served the purpose of relocating him to Washington, D.C., the Washington School of Psychiatry (WSP) founded by Dr. Harry Stack Sullivan, was the major draw and the real reason Bill agreed to take the CIA position. He couldn’t know in the beginning how important his association with John Gittinger and the PAS would turn out to be long term, but he did know he was fascinated by Sullivan’s philosophy, with its focus on interpersonal relations. This pattern of emphasis on relationships anticipates the central role they will play later on in A Course In Miracles. Sullivan was also intrigued by personality development in children, another interest Bill shared with him. Incidentally, more than half the professional papers Bill published before he moved to Washington focused on children."

#: paragraph:167
msgid "Once again, that inevitable pull toward self-discovery, yearning for an undefined something just out of reach, was at work. At the WSP he was able to study with some of the brightest lights in psychology and psychiatry at the time, usually in the evening so not to interfere with his work at the CIA, taking every class offered. The philosophy of the school was consistent with the work he had done earlier with Carl Rogers and was very helpful with his work at the Agency."

msgid "Idealists heavily populate the social sciences, particularly the fields of mental healing and personal or religious counseling—professions directed toward human metamorphosis, or the unfolding of the mind and heart toward greater self-understanding and spiritual peace. NFs find great satisfaction in the mental health services, where they tend to take the most humanistic of approaches, those advocating growth models of counseling and psychotherapy rather than the more confronting or controlling models.[30]"

msgid "Bill and I were in a class on psychological testing and I thought I was pretty good but, by golly, I had this one case and it was something, it was terrific, and Bill just ran circles not only around me but everybody else. It was amazing what he could come up with. Subsequently, I learned that he did this on the basis of his work with John Gittinger, who later funded his research up in New York. He had developed an approach to personality assessment that was quite unique. The only problem was that it certainly didn’t work all the time or even necessarily most of the time, but when it did, it was fantastic. This was one of those times when it worked. Now in fairness both to Bill and to John, though esoteric, it is an approach still carried on by its followers and used very extensively by the Agency around the world.[31]"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:173
msgid "Over the years, it became apparent to many that, in addition to his excellent training and education, Bill had a specific, innate aptitude for interpreting tests; psychometrics was his strong suit. Bill did base much of his case work on John Gittinger’s research but, of course, also brought his own intuitive talent to bear. Another passage from Please Understand Me, II illustrates this:"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:174
msgid "Idealists are naturally inductive in their thought and speech, which is to say that they move quickly from part to whole, from a few particulars to sweeping generalizations, from the smallest sign of something to its entirety. With their focus on unseen potentials, on the not visible and the not yet, Idealists show an extraordinary sensitivity to hints of things, mere suggestions, inklings, intimations, symbols. To be sure, such inductive inferences, requiring what is called the “intuitive leap,” can be astonishing to others, especially in cases of mind reading and extra-sensory perception. At the very least, Idealists are the best suited of all the types to read between the lines, to have a sixth sense about people, and they do indeed follow their hunches, heed their feelings, and insist they “just know” what people are really up to or what they really mean. Even with complicated issues, NFs need hear only the first words of an explanation to feel they understand the subject fully, jumping from telling details to larger meanings.[32]"

msgid "A third CIA colleague referred to Bill as very congenial, well liked, and conscientious in his work; he was trusted with all kinds of secrets—early evidence of his ability to compartmentalize various areas of his life and play his cards close to the chest. He said that at one point, as Bill was assigned potential employees to evaluate, the Agency apparently decided that some interviews, certainly those involving foreign agents (spies), should occur somewhere other than the CIA offices. Thus, Bill conducted some of these at a local hotel and, for a while, actually lived there on the Agency’s behalf, subletting his own apartment to this friend and colleague because the CIA thought it might appear strange if he were at the hotel consistently in the daytime, but left no trace of sleeping there."

#: paragraph:176
msgid "It’s difficult to convey just how out of character Bill’s later affiliation with ACIM seemed to those who knew him as a dedicated and accomplished psychologist with the Agency. One woman saw the article in Psychology Today (September 1980) about the Course and Bill’s involvement in it and thought it so strange because it was atypical of his interests when she knew him. In fact, before the Course became central to his life, Bill and many of his associates thought religion lacked intellectual respectability. Although deeply involved with the psychological aspects of his fellow human beings, Bill was not at all interested in organized religion or spirituality. In his youth, his parents followed the Christian Science teachings, but after the death of their first two children and Bill’s severe illness, they lost faith in religion and never returned to it. Thus, they never encouraged him in this area, although as noted earlier, he did sing at the Chicago Lawn Congregational Church as a teenager. I would guess this was motivated by his great love of music and an opportunity to sing rather than by any interest in theology."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:177
msgid "Bill was more traditional by today’s standards but quite on the leading edge of psychology for that time. Goodrich spoke with John Gittinger before his death expressly to discuss Bill’s role with A Course In Miracles. In that conversation, he told John that Bill had mentioned his fear of losing the research grants funded indirectly by Gittinger if he had learned of his involvement with A Course In Miracles. John replied, “Oh, heavens, no! I wondered what he was doing and would have been skeptical, but tolerant.”[33] He added that, since Bill was doing such great work for him, he would not in any way have withheld support."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:178
msgid "The intricacies of how Bill received support from Gittinger is beyond the scope of this book, but through him and his continuing covert CIA connections, Bill was awarded ongoing, substantial grants to continue refining the PAS. Those grants followed him to Columbia University; both he and Helen Schucman were conducting PAS research there, among other projects, when the Course entered their lives. That research continued in parallel throughout the scribing of ACIM, as Bill regarded the PAS system as the most sophisticated personality test available at the time. Of course, research on assessing personality traits and their consequent behaviors extended far beyond usefulness to the CIA; it was well within the civilian domain of research psychology and took place at other institutions besides Columbia. (For a list of Bill’s publications related to that research, please see Appendix Two.)"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:179
msgid "It is important to correct and clarify some false and misleading information currently on the Internet concerning Bill’s years with the CIA. After Bill’s death, John Gittinger himself stressed that although Bill worked tirelessly on refining the PAS, he was never involved with the operational side of the CIA, including any behavior manipulation, drug experiments, mind control, or anything that could possibly be considered coloring outside the lines of propriety. In fact, persons on the operational side were somewhat scornful of the psychological approach to information gathering and preferred more dramatic exploration and practices. Also, the paymaster in charge of sending grant-related funds to Bill, a personal friend of Whit Whitson, has stated unequivocally that none of Bill’s funding ever came through MKUltra, a controversial experimental project. Some Internet articles falsely state that Bill was funded through that project."

msgid "Bill had seemed restless even as he began his work at the CIA, perhaps realizing this was only a point along his career path but not a long-term commitment. In 1953, after gaining experience with the Agency and having completed his work at the Washington School of Psychiatry, he felt it was time to move on and gave notice to that effect. One colleague said she believed that, although he was fascinated by Gittinger’s work, Bill recognized that a great deal of it was based on intuition and seemed somewhat unscientific. She speculated he may have left the Agency for other institutions in order to search for a hard scientific basis for the derived assessments, as that type of research was not part of his primary job there—testing and evaluating potential intelligence officers. She was at least partly right."

This assignment was topped off by several weeks of vacation in Europe and the Middle East. He said, in retrospect, that his Middle East trip was the most marvelous of his life. After returning, he was generously promised a range of positions with the Agency, not necessarily in Washington, and felt some obligation to stay on for a while. He continued with the CIA until the summer of 1954, then was impelled to move on."

Although he indicated he wanted to live in the city, the head of the service said, “They want you in Hartford [CT]. That’s where you have to go, the Institute of Living.”[34] He sent Bill immediately to the institute, an adjunct of the Hartford Hospital, one of the first mental health centers in the country and then the largest psychiatric hospital in the United States. There is now reason to believe that, unknown to Bill at the time, the CIA had a covert hand in steering him in that direction, and at the ripe old age of thirty-one, he was hired as director of clinical psychology. Although many well-known people were doing interesting things at the institute, he felt it was not quite his place; it was not New York. He did leave his imprint there, however, and according to the 1956 annual report, the Division of Clinical Psychology under Bill’s direction expanded its research to include “better diagnosis of organic pathology through psychological tests, the use of projective techniques in predicting aggressive behavior, and appraising changes resulting from psychotherapy.”[35] This research was indeed a continuation of his work with the PAS, and John Gittinger was involved with its funding."

Bill used to joke that if his qualification for employment at Michael Reese Hospital had been to know nothing about the Rorschach test, his qualifications for the Cornell position were singular. Not only was his work in Washington germane to the Cornell program, he was the only clinical psychologist around with top secret security clearance and trained in neurophysiology. Dr. Wolff had been offered the opportunity to do cross-cultural studies funded by the CIA and he hired Bill as head of the psychological research program. Part of Bill’s job was to revise the PAS for use with foreign cultures, particularly the Chinese. In addition to his research work there, which was primary, he also became first an instructor and soon thereafter an assistant professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry."

I could never eat anything because Wolff would start interrogating me the minute I sat down. “What have you learned this morning in terms of highest integrative functions? Are you going to change this and get our next publication out by tomorrow?” He used to go on and on like that, so I would never eat lunch. I was used to working under high pressure, but I wasn’t used to that sort of thing. I did turn things out pretty fast, though, and I could type quickly. When he wanted something he would say, “I’m leaving in a few minutes; would you please prepare an abstract for the International Biological Psychiatry Congress. I’ll have to have it in fifteen minutes.” I would go to my typewriter and dash off what he wanted. I would tap into some inner source and put it into some sort of English. I learned to make it sound super scientific.[36]"

That intuition or guidance is always present for all of us, but we normally pay little if any attention to it, relying instead on our intellects and personal desires to direct us until that proves futile and we start honoring our inner wisdom. This is a particular conflict for those who pride themselves on being rigorously scientific, as Bill did, but who also are very aware of “just knowing.” He indicated that in his early days he acknowledged this gift and took it for granted, but felt he couldn’t talk about it, fearing he would be misunderstood."

While conducting research with them and their particular reactions to stress, he was abruptly asked to go to China on a secret mission to escort Harriet Mills on her return to the United States. She was a Fulbright Scholar and Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University. While doing field research there for her dissertation, Mills had come under suspicion and was subsequently jailed by the Communist government. The daughter of Presbyterian missionaries, Mills was born in Japan but reared in China, was fluent in the language, and familiar with Chinese customs—all of which had raised a red flag for them. After four and a half years, she was finally tried, released, and ordered to leave the country."

He was booked passage on a freighter, the last available vessel out of Hong Kong, where Mills had been taken after being put on trial and expelled from China. Bill said in his biography, “All arrangements were made secretly and undercover. I was not told where I was first going, which was Manila [Philippines], before proceeding to Hong Kong to board the ship.”[37] The freighter was Mills’ choice of transportation after her years in a Beijing prison. As there were only a handful of passengers, Bill and Harriet met almost immediately and became friends. She later told her sister, with whom I spoke in 2007, that after a few days she realized Bill was “put on board to grill her.” She was right. He took notes on thin paper and kept them hidden in his pockets. He didn’t want to leave anything lying around indiscriminately, as he didn’t know who else might be on the ship watching them. They arrived safely in Vancouver, Canada, just before Christmas of 1955, and his extensive notes were ultimately included as part of Harold Wolff’s testimony before the House Committee on brainwashing in 1975. According to her sister, Mills still won’t talk about what happened during her confinement, so we don’t know what she may have disclosed to Bill, who elicited deep trust from virtually everyone. He particularly enjoyed telling this story and was highly amused by the drama of the intrigue, especially since the mission had a satisfactory ending."

The job offered—designing a doctoral program, writing grants, and assuming an assistant professorship—didn’t particularly appeal to him, but out of courtesy he agreed to meet with the head of the psychiatry department. Bill told him, thinking he could bring this episode to closure before it began, that he might be interested if they offered him a higher professional rank, which he was certain they would not consider as medical school hierarchies are quite rigid. To his surprise, they accepted his condition, added a prestigious title, and in the fall of 1957 appointed him to the faculty as an associate professor of medical psychology in the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University Medical School. As with his clandestine trip to Hong Kong, he always laughed as he told these stories, as if the way everything had turned out, the improbable series of events, was all a delightful comedy."

Jack Luckett’s conversations with Bill also supported this hypothesis; Bill believed the Agency had a hand in arranging his various career opportunities. It especially makes sense given the Agency’s propensity to develop a person’s strengths, to push them along, so to speak. Gittinger told Dr. Marshall Heyman, another former CIA colleague of Bill’s, that Bill and later Helen were the only two “outsiders” (non-CIA employees—Bill was an ex-employee and Helen never worked for the CIA, nor did she know it was the source of some of their funding) at that time whom he authorized to talk publicly about, hold seminars on, and generally endorse the PAS and their research related to it. Other institutions and individuals were doing PAS research, but Bill and Helen became Gittinger’s surrogates of sorts, since he could not publicly comment on his internal classified research. In later years, Gittinger, by then head of the CIA’s psychological services worldwide, visited Bill and Helen in New York and sometimes attended their seminars anonymously. He very much enjoyed the company of the academics there and being involved with someone of Bill’s reputation and stature."

The archivist at Columbia University, with whom I spoke in 2008, found records for six of the grants listed on Bill’s curriculum vitae obtained from 1961–1964, totaling $120,410. He received additional grant money but the records could not be found. Publication of PAS-related research continued until the early 1970s. Psychological Assessment Associates, Gittinger’s non-CIA business that promoted the PAS, had a file card on record at Columbia, but there was no attendant folder or paperwork related to it."

Not yet thirty-five, he was additionally appointed as director of the Division of Psychology at Presbyterian Hospital, an adjunct to Columbia University and the largest private medical center in the country employing thousands of people. He was responsible for all clinical psychology practiced there. Attempting to bring order and cohesion to an essentially unorganized department was wearing and complicated, given the disparate organizations involved and the turf battles and jealousies that plague so much of academia. In addition, he was required to include the New York State Psychiatric Institute in his attempt at administrative reorganization. Ultimately, therefore, he had responsibilities at the hospital, the university, and the institute, which he found incredibly complicated. And the majority of his work history was in research and writing, not administration, so the challenges were immense."

Although he was certainly knowledgeable in the general field of tests and measurements and had a great deal of experience working with children, he had not designed tests for them and needed a specialist in this area. He checked with a colleague, well known in the field, who promised to help if he could.

In retrospect, colleagues at the time noted that Bill produced a prodigious amount of “regular” work, all expertly handled, while his secret life with the Course was ongoing. For one thing, Bill could multitask in a very unusual way; he could, for instance, type the notes for one research project while discussing the details of something entirely unrelated.

A number of psychologists were working independently throughout the hospital, some of whom had never even met. In fact, a major though not previously specified part of Bill’s job had been to organize and administer a cohesive departmental unit. It was a hard assignment. When I arrived the newly established department was split into factions, and beset by political rivalries and bitter resentments. Besides the obvious hostilities there was also a curious apathy toward the department. Bill seemed to be the only person there who really cared about it. As he told me one day, “I would do anything for the department,” and it was evident that he meant it.

Both considered experts in their field, they were often called in jointly to consult on “high-powered private patients” at Columbia; other psychological associations in New York City also invited them to share their expertise. Dorothy Ulmann, a colleague at Cornell University in New York City, remembered, “Once in a while I’d go up there [Columbia] with Helen and Bill and their colleagues.

msgid "Obviously, from Bill’s recounting of what the university was like in general and his relationships with Helen and others in particular, he was projecting his own “shadow side,” his long-held fears and grievances, into his situation there. Every beginning ACIM student learns that the subjective experience of one’s outer circumstances faithfully reflects an inner state of mind. Stated more bluntly, the more guilt one carries, even though unconsciously, the more one feels punished by outer conditions. Bill certainly contributed to the problems in his environment as he projected his own judgments, fears, unconscious conditioning, and unexamined assumptions about how life should be into the situation, as do we all. He knew about projection theoretically—the process of seeing in others what we fear to own in ourselves—but clearly knew little about dealing with that process personally. Despite his talents, training, and potential, he was as sound asleep as the rest of us. Early in ACIM’s text, one finds, “Yet the Bible says that a deep sleep fell upon Adam, and nowhere is there reference to his waking up. The world has not yet experienced any comprehensive reawakening or rebirth. Such a rebirth is impossible as long as you continue to project or mis-create.”[43] After the Course arrived and Bill became more familiar with its uncompromising tenets on how we cause our own distress, he ultimately became willing to begin changing his mind, and that willingness led to success—to his actual waking up."

During part of those New York years, Bill and another friend owned a small house in Watermill on Long Island, and Helen actually paid for a room and bath to be added to the house for her and her husband. She insisted on being included in all aspects of his life, inside the university and out. Everyone noticed this infringement on Bill’s time and space. Cal Hatcher, an administrator at the hospital and a good friend of Bill’s, commented, “I think sometimes I’d go out of my skin if I were Bill. This was because Helen would call him up anytime, day or night.”[47] Ken Wapnick later confirmed that to call Helen possessive was definitely the mildest of understatements.

Those dreams and waking visions, in retrospect, pointed to the coming of ACIM, but at the time seemed obscure and unintelligible. For instance, one vision involved Helen’s seeing herself in a small boat being carried along a lovely canal. She mused about the possibility of buried treasure in the area and noticed a long pole with a hook in the bottom of the boat. She dropped the hook into the water and pulled up an ancient treasure chest; on opening it, she was disappointed to find nothing but a large black book, specifically a black thesis binder, exactly like those that would be used years later to store the typed notes of A Course In Miracles for safekeeping. Down the spine was written one word in gold, Aesculapius. Neither Bill nor Helen knew what it meant, although it had a familiar ring to it. A few nights later, she dreamed of that black book again, now with pearls draped around it. Aesculapius was the Greek god of healing and historians believe the legends surrounding his medical work were based on the life of an historical person. A well-known physician of the second century, Galen, did much research at the Aesculapion in Pergamon, Turkey (then part of the Roman Empire), and embodied the Aesculapion traditions for treating not just the physically but the mentally ill, as well.

I was standing in front of a simple brown wooden altar, on which two words were written one underneath the other. I cannot imagine a less appropriate pair. The top word was “Elohim,” which I did not recognize at the time, and only later discovered is one of the Hebrew names for God. The other word, “Evoe,” I did identify as the cry of the Greek Bacchantes [a priestess or female votary of Bacchus; a female participant in a drunken or orgiastic revel] in celebrating the rites of Bacchus [the god of grape-growing and of wine]. As I watched, a streak of lightning from the back of the church struck the altar and obliterated the second word entirely. Only “Elohim” remained, written in bright gold letters. The Hallelujah Chorus rose to a crescendo, and a figure outlined in brilliant light which I recognized immediately as Jesus stepped from behind the altar and came toward me. I started to kneel in front of him, but he came around to my side and knelt at the altar with me. Bill rose and knelt at his other side.

Sometimes she asked the Voice to repeat an unclear message; in response, the material then showed up on a sort of interior “blackboard” where she could read it. She said all the writing was voluntary, never “automatic writing,” which she could start and stop at will, and she was pleased with its coherence even though the material was antithetical to everything she believed. That, she said, confused her no end. She ended her commentary by saying that the process of scribing is simply impossible to explain in words: “I do not understand the events that led up to the writing, I do not understand the process, and I certainly do not understand the authorship.

Therefore, Helen’s decision-making mind identified itself with the non-ego presence that is in everyone. This non-judgmental thought system of love was represented for her by Jesus, as it is for so many of us. Her mind took that non-specific love and translated it into words, in much the same way as our brains translate the upside-down image cast on the retina into right-side-up perceptions. And so, as I have said many times, the form of the Course is from Helen. . . . The content of A Course in Miracles, however, is clearly not Helen’s, at least not the Helen the world knew or the person she consciously identified with. This explains why she felt at liberty to change the form, though never the content. Helen knew what the published Course ought to be.

She required not only support but the confidence that he gave simply from the power of his presence. . . . His respect, admiration, and appreciation for her helped her go on. They were a team and he knew that.”[72] All who knew him commented on the obvious—Bill was an equal, essential part of the Course’s coming forth; he held the key to its transmission and was ultimately responsible for its coming to pass.

There is within you a deep, abiding love, a love which goes back centuries into the past, and it is the expression of a love, a connection initially made in the ancient land of Egypt. You were both in the male form and your work involved the founding of a school that became a kind of guideline for the training of the priesthood that would form the foundations of the consciousness of healing in the Egyptian religion of its time. The school itself was thwarted, aborted. And the commitment to establish this energy as a teaching has now been brought into this present time. It will be done without the form of the traditional school, but is still the teaching that is here before you. . . . There is perhaps one additional idea. When this effort in ancient Saqqara [Egypt] was initiated, this entity, Helen, was in the male form. You were both in the male form at that time, as you know, and the energy there was intensely powerful.

And much of your work has thus been involved in communicating with only one person or a very small and/or select group. That energy from those life experiences is very much a part of your consciousness. It’s a very powerful memory that acts as a resistance to your present setting since you are no longer in the priesthood but have been in an academic environment where that same secluded atmosphere has been prevalent. . . . Part of this fear comes from the past. In the priesthood role, your teaching was, as it were, protected. It came out of a very sacred dimension that might be challenged by the outer world, but never fully challenged because the priesthood acts as a shield to protect it. Therefore, whatever the priests have taught, be it true or false, has had the aura of the Church to give it sanction. However, in this life, that is no longer available to you. Now you are drawing much closer to the Source and having to stand alone without the shield as you make the statements that need to be made. . . .

The Voice indicated that the confidence in them was not misplaced, as their commitment and agreement to do this work was already known. Eventually, they realized the inevitability of their commitment, and neither seriously considered giving it up. The answer Bill gave, in the few interviews he granted, to the question of “Why us?” was “Because you’re doing it.” That was a correct but insufficient answer. In the Urtext, defined as “a reconstructed proto-text set up as the basis of variants in extant later texts,”[77] and in this case, Bill’s original, unedited typed notes of ACIM, the Author gave them a more complete and direct answer:"

But this is a form of faith, which you yourselves had grown willing to redirect. You cannot doubt the strength of your devotion when you consider how faithfully you observed it. It was quite evident that you had already developed the ability to follow a better model, if you could accept it.[78]"

Bill assured him he was talking to the wrong guy, because he had no knowledge or interest in such subjects at that time. Therefore, when ACIM turned his values, his assumptions, and his very life upside down, Bill instinctively knew Cal was the person he could trust with their secret. Although this thought system was entirely different from anything he had learned or that psychology taught, it seemed imminently practical and thus very appealing. He was anxious to try it out. Predictably, Helen was more than upset when he told her that Cal would now be his confidant. Bill wrote:"

For several years we met in my office early in the morning, before 8am, because we had to meet before scheduled activities. I would go over the material that I had typed the preceding day and try to explain it to Cal. This was my attempt to learn what it meant by trying to teach it to him, and it was enormously helpful. Cal knew much more than I did about the Bible, which was all very new to me. He had a critical, inquiring mind, and wanted to know what this meant, what the implications might be. This gave me my first opportunity to try to find out what I thought about it. Our talks were extremely helpful and made it possible for Helen and me to continue even when I felt we were not learning it together. It was much more difficult to go over the material with Helen.[79]"

In fact, he felt their situation worsened as the Course continued to unfold. Helen became increasingly hostile as she projected onto Bill the sense of threat engendered by the material, and from his perspective, she actively attempted to undermine him. He took the Course statements seriously and literally when it referred to “you, Helen and Bill,” which they later translated throughout the books into “the two of you” or “you and your brother.” He agonized over the observable lack of progress with her; he used to say it was impossible to express how much this seeming failure with Helen upset him. And his ongoing angst with her was just a subplot in the pressure cooker that was the highly competitive medical center. As he commented later, “Much of the time what I felt was a constant temptation to walk the plank.”[80]"

msgid "Because increased upset is such a common experience for new students of ACIM, I believe it should be addressed. I have worked with many people who found that at some point in their early practice of the Course, life seemed to get worse rather than better. In fact, in my classes I warn students this is likely to happen and that it’s reasonable to ask why they should embark on a practice that might stir up more upset. The answer, of course, is that sooner or later it’s our only choice. Addressing our fears is ultimately required of everyone, not to inflict punishment but because this is how to release them. Bill found—as everyone eventually finds—that tolerance for pain is only so high. The introduction to the text speaks of removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence. When we ask for help, we become aware of those blocks or fears so that we can address them directly and make happier, more sane and peaceful choices."

Bill told me that Art thought she certainly did excellent research work but that she was too much trouble, a high-maintenance lady and distracting at meetings.

Art never put down his newspaper, so after a while Bill left. Every day for about a month Bill went in and Art never put down his paper or acknowledged him. By then he felt much more comfortable and knew that he was guided to persevere. One day he said, “Good morning, Art,” who grunted from behind his newspaper. For Bill, this was a very big sign. After several months of this routine, Bill had an early morning appointment elsewhere and came to his office later than usual. Around lunchtime, Bill saw Art, who said, “Where were you this morning?

Art approached Bill and asked if he would like to share a room, stating, “There is no one here I would rather be with.” Bill said he would be delighted, and after unpacking their things, they went down to the bar before dinner. As they sat there talking and waiting for dinner to be announced, Art took three almonds from a little bowl on their table, passed them to Bill, and said, “Edgar Cayce says they’re very good for you.” Bill said he nearly dropped his front teeth. “Edgar Cayce, Art?” Art replied, “Yes, he’s this very famous psychic. During the war I was stationed in Virginia Beach and I used to go to his house for lunch on Sundays. He was really a very great guy.” Bill said at that moment he knew it was over. The situation with Art was the first time he had deliberately practiced ACIM, and of course, their changed relationship improved the department’s functioning. This quiet way was typical of Bill. He didn’t go to Art saying, “Look, I know how you’re feeling about the situation and I don’t blame you, but you’re making me really uncomfortable and here are the reasons for my decisions,” etc. Instead, he sat there in the chair quietly.[81]"

Although the claims regarding Cayce’s abilities seemed preposterous by his own scientific standards, Bill sensed inwardly that the stories about him were legitimate. On that basis, he planned a trip for Helen and himself to Virginia Beach to meet Hugh Lynn. Helen resisted going as she didn’t want to be considered a “psychic” or be associated with them, although she was privately impressed with her growing psychic abilities. She was often ambivalent about rejecting or embracing aspects of herself. Their visit took place in the fall of 1965 after her several months of “heightened visual imagery,” just before the Course began in October. Bill always thought that trip gave her “permission” to open up to her immense intuitive abilities and also provided some rudimentary preparation for him. He began to think “outside the box” and looked with growing, though quiet, appreciation of his own intuitive abilities."

In his search for corroboration, he discovered the nondualistic teaching of Advaita Vedanta from India and immediately saw its parallels to the Course. Thus he dubbed ACIM the “Christian Vedanta” because of its use of Christian language to present these truths. He became more impressed with the Course as his study deepened, finding it integrated and synthesized the best of the teachings he investigated—and it was practical. He read extensively in his newly discovered field of interest and became extremely well versed in this formerly uninteresting subject. Many of Bill’s friends and colleagues said he had an astounding capacity to absorb vast quantities of written material quickly, a valuable trait given that he had five thousand years of mystical traditions to explore. Years later, he noted with some disappointment that the PAS, on which he had lavished so much time and attention, did not explain or even address the spiritual dimension of our life experience. How unexpectedly our lives can change and even reverse course."

msgid "As Bill was deepening his research into metaphysics, he became intrigued with a chapter about mysticism and schizophrenia in the book, Higher States of Consciousness, by John White. It was written by Kenneth Wapnick, a young psychologist, and Bill shared it with one of his graduate students, Father Benedict, a Capuchin friar. Benedict, one of the three or four people entrusted with their “guilty secret,” as Bill jokingly called it, subsequently became friendly with Ken and later introduced him to Bill and Helen. Shortly after they met in late 1972, Ken left New York for Israel to live in a monastery, presumably to be his permanent home, having converted from Judaism to Catholicism. Once there, however, he couldn’t get that meeting out of his mind; he dreamt of it, aware of a very strong connection with both of them, especially Helen. His guidance prevailed and in the spring of 1973, as if on cue, he returned to New York (the last place he thought he wanted to be) to meet with them again and to find out more about the manuscript his new friends had mentioned to him earlier. One look and that intriguing book “knocked him off his feet,” to use his words—his fate was sealed. He notified his Israeli friends of his change of plans and re-established himself in New York to be close to “ACIM Central.” Thus, as the dictation was concluding, Kenneth Wapnick officially entered the picture, commencing three more years of editing, rereading, checking for errors, and improving section and chapter titles."

Ken’s services were badly needed and truly appreciated, but they came at a price from his perspective. Helen and Ken’s apparent mutual adoration, which developed right away, was the perfect setup to trigger within Bill a deep sense of rejection and betrayal. Notice the word is trigger and not cause, as that feeling of rejection was already in place.

I can give you one example that typified the whole issue. They had three offices, an outer office and their two private offices, very secluded. You have to picture this. We were sitting in Helen’s office; there was Helen and her desk, I sat against the wall adjacent to her desk, and Bill would be standing in the doorway, which he would do since every once in a while he would go to his office and smoke. I was literally in the middle. Bill, who did this more often than Helen, tried to put me in the middle [of their battle]. I don’t remember what it was about, but they were at each other’s throats. They were sniping at each other, the tension was building, and Bill turned to me, asking me to support him against Helen, saying something like, “Wouldn’t you agree, Kenneth?” It was obvious they were both contributing, but Bill, I know, was not conscious of what he was doing. He was being very snide; he was wonderful with words, a master. I finessed it by saying, “Well, you’re both doing it,” which was true. Bill stormed out, really angry; Helen looked at me and said, “Now you see what I’m up against.” She meant Bill’s being passive aggressive and not knowing it; that was very, very common. He was just not aware of his own anger and how he was expressing it. Helen was just as much at fault, but she was right in your face, she knew what she was doing.

msgid "Obviously, this monumental work was not destined to remain in the bottom drawer. In the spring of 1975, through a serendipitous series of events, Bill and Helen placed ACIM into the capable hands of Judith Skutch (Whitson), who became the undisputed matriarch of A Course In Miracles and ultimately provided for its publication and widespread distribution. Bill had become intrigued with a new acquaintance, Douglas Dean—a scientist interested in paranormal healing—and had made plans to have lunch with him. Dean rescheduled their meeting so he could bring his friend, Judith Skutch, for he felt strongly that she should accompany him. Judy was known as a “cosmic catalyst and den mother to parapsychology,” a leader in the field of consciousness exploration and the paranormal. On May 29, 1975, Judy, Douglas, Helen, Bill, and Ken had lunch in the faculty dining room at Columbia. During lunch, as their conversation evolved, Judy found herself unexpectedly saying to Helen, “You’re hearing a voice, aren’t you?” Everyone was stunned. Therefore, after lunch in the privacy of Bill’s office, the three collaborators showed Judy and Douglas the Course, still a secret known only to a handful of people."

She was overwhelmed with the Course’s material. Helen and I liked Judy immediately, and we all—she, Ken, and I—became fast friends. Judy’s arrival on the scene was both fortuitous and miraculous. She had a very specific role, although we didn’t know it in the beginning.[97]"

msgid "Almost immediately, Judy became an integral part of the ACIM enterprise, and Ken, Helen, and Bill spent more and more time at the Skutch home in Manhattan. Shortly after their meeting, they began to discuss the possibility of publishing the material. Bill and Helen would not have tackled this on their own, but Judy had the necessary skill and enthusiasm, and it became a serious consideration. They showed the work to several friends possibly interested in publishing it, but all wanted to change it in some way. As with every decision related to the Course, they jointly consulted their guidance and were told to leave it intact and publish it themselves. They questioned this advice from a financial perspective but were told to commit and trust. They did. The day after committing to its publication, Judy received a call from Reed Erickson, a satisfied and inspired student (of a xeroxed copy), who said he felt ACIM needed to be published officially and that he was sending a check for $60,000 to fund the first five thousand sets. (Originally, the text, workbook, and teacher’s manual were bound as separate books and later combined into one volume.)"

msgid "Several years before their meeting, Judy and her husband at the time, Robert Skutch, had founded a nonprofit organization, the Foundation for Parasensory Investigation, to help fund research for parapsychology. Deciding that name did not convey the purpose of ACIM, they all agreed to retitle it the Foundation for Inner Peace, and in 1975 Helen entrusted to it the copyright to A Course In Miracles. As of October 2003, the original copyright entered into the public domain. However, the Foundation for Inner Peace, the parent organization, and its sister organization, the Foundation for A Course In Miracles, are the repositories of all original archival materials."

msgid "Bill became a big supporter of Judy’s; they were very, very close. Since I was identified with Helen, it’s as if sides had been chosen as far as they were concerned, and Helen would get annoyed if I spent time with Bill. She withdrew more and more. She and Bill argued less because he wasn’t around as much. He spent more and more time with Judy and I spent more time with Helen and Louis. We would meet at Judy’s apartment, then Helen and I would go home and Bill would stay. From his point of view, Judy was a breath of fresh air; he was very comfortable with her, enjoying a relationship that didn’t include Helen. Helen had her own relationship with Judy, who was now sometimes the recipient of her anger, but still they were close. When both Bill and Judy moved to the West Coast in 1978, that was the end as far as Helen was concerned. She was very bitter about that, but I think Bill felt a sense of freedom. That’s when everything changed for him, like he was let out of prison. But again, to Helen’s credit, she was always well aware of what she was doing and that made dealing with her easier in a way. She was very possessive of me and other people. She was furious at Bill, but in fact she knew that I knew, and I knew that she knew, and we really didn’t talk much about it because what’s the point? That’s how she was, how she wanted to be."

msgid "I think when Judy came along they were very happy to step back. They both felt comfortable turning the reins over to her and gave a big sigh of relief, “Okay we’re done.” They both made the decision and it was not right or wrong, it’s just what they did. Bill felt a clear sense of mission and purpose for this Course; Helen felt that, too, and they were very faithful to it. However, they did not see that they had to be faithful to each other in the sense of healing the relationship and they did not feel their role included anything else. I think it was unfortunate that they abdicated all responsibility for the Course. They gave it to Judy to take to the world and basically withdrew from any kind of leadership or authority. If they hadn’t, the Course would have gone a different way. Although nothing is better nor worse, there are alternate scripts and I think there was clearly a script for Helen, Bill, and myself to have more of a sense of responsibility for shepherding the Course. It was also very clear to me that Helen could have written down more things, but she refused. Bill, as you know, . . . had such conflict over being an authority, being a teacher, that he went the other way—he became a nonauthority. It was always bizarre when we had those meetings and Bill said nothing as the most outrageous things were being said. Not that he had to say something, but it was clear he chose not to. I think it was a real fear of being an authority, which he was. Until that meeting in Hawaii in 1985 [a one-time workshop featuring the early Course “family” sponsored by the Unity Church in Honolulu], I had never heard him speak publicly with a prepared talk, rather than simply answering questions, and he was masterful, very funny, very good, a wonderful voice. But seeing his fear of standing up and professing, that never left me. He had a wonderful presence, was a wonderful speaker, but he chose not to do it, and Helen, who was not afraid of teaching—she was an excellent teacher—nonetheless, did not want any more of this Course.[98]"

He avoided everything that would bring him notoriety related to ACIM; he gave very few interviews for print media about the Course and did not make TV appearances or write books under his own name, although he substantively assisted others with theirs. Until the end of their lives, neither Bill nor Helen had any desire to be in the spotlight; they consistently withdrew from public attention."

msgid "By the mid 1970s, the Course was finished and its next phase was unfolding with Judy at the helm. The four principals—Judy, Bill, Helen, and Ken—had established a pattern of meeting regularly at the Skutch apartment in the late afternoons. Judy confirms Ken’s observations that when Bill and Helen were working on their scholastic endeavors—about 90 percent of their time—hostility was the norm. However, when they were involved with Course dictation and transcription, or what needed to be done with it, they were of one mind, merging as “Bilen,” a contraction of Bill and Helen denoting their beautiful sense of communion and shared purpose. So there were times during those late afternoon meetings when all was tranquil and others when it most certainly was not."

During those moments, he must have been driven to uncontrollable distress, because virtually everyone I’ve spoken with has commented on Bill’s extreme patience with Helen as she acted out her more preposterous ego positions. At other times, their personal war would escalate even further. Judy remembers the following example in vivid detail:"

msgid "Bill, Helen, Ken, and I were in our New York apartment late one afternoon, a sparkling, unusually clear October day. It was so impressive that everyone had considered going for a walk, but it never materialized. We were talking and Helen and Bill got into a scrap. They were sitting next to each other on a loveseat opposite where Ken and I were sitting, and it was like watching two cats suddenly rear up their backs and spit at each other. Characteristically, Helen would attack and Bill would defend. Finally, the words were flying and Ken knew enough to get up, kindly take Bill by the arm, and guide him out on our back landing for a smoke. Bill was smoking up a storm in those days. Helen stood up—she was very erect for a tiny person as she deliberately practiced her posture—and she was seething! Her fists were clinched and her shoulders heaved with rage. She went to the window and looked out at Central Park, a happy, busy, peaceful scene—people riding bikes, mothers and children, nannies, dogs. She was looking but seeing nothing, just looking out the window and shaking. I made the mistake of putting my arm around her shoulder and said, “Mama (she liked for me to call her Mama), why can’t you be a little nicer to him?” which was really a dumb thing to do."

I’m going to give you a little bit every day and he’s going to be so intrigued, believe me, he’ll never leave you.” There was all this furious, romantic rage and fantasy life, a lot of fantasy life, in her mind with Bill. This was not the only time.

To benefit from the life-altering change of perspective taught through the Course, they would have to practice like everyone else. At this point, both their lives were certifiably a mess despite their brilliance and accomplishments. And all who feel hopeless, take note: Their egos were just like ours. Revealing their “dark sides” encourages us to do the same to facilitate our healing. It is fascinating and reassuring to know that from such intractable egocentricity, the Course, one of the most beautiful and profound teachings on earth, sprang forth easily and without compromise. Helen and Bill, despite fearing they were not healing as they should, steadfastly set aside their egos to produce it. Even in the midst of her frequent panic, Helen could completely suspend her ego and allow herself to enter into her right mind where the material existed already complete. Carefully and with great integrity, she listened and scribed. It seems she could move back and forth between her ego and spirit, her wrong and right mind, with more skill than almost anyone on the planet. For her, the veil was very thin."

I was aware of feeling close to Helen at some level that transcended rationality and relationship barriers. It seemed to go against any form of logic. I wasn’t that fond of Helen, but there was a deep love that continued in spite of everything. It had nothing to do with anything. It seemed to represent our joining in love and cooperation. We tried to do something that transcended our egos. That was the thing that seemed real, the only thing that seemed really to persist. Once having done that, there was no breaking away from it. It was a commitment that went on forever. If love is eternal, when you make that kind of commitment, you have made it. It doesn’t have anything to do with the usual things about commitments.[103]"

The Course’s aim is to undo that perspective. It encourages us always to ask, “What is this for? How are we using these gifts?” Bill developed talents and acquired experience, as do we all, and was motivated by ACIM’s teachings to move from a sense of specialness—the desire to appropriate his particular portfolio of talents for personal gain—to his own unique special function, using those same gifts for a higher purpose. This shift in purpose provides the ideal opportunity for the unfolding of our own service and, thus, for maximal healing."

We need take only a cursory, unbiased look at the condition of the world to know that something is terribly wrong. It appears to be the domain of pain and suffering, and for most, that is the case. ACIM teaches, however, this need not be. Our beliefs, attitudes, self-absorption, and attachment to having our way, our unconscious programming, our endless attack, all can and must be changed if we are to be free of insecurity and lack. And it shows us how."

Like everyone, he began with a divided or compromised dedication, but the Course promises that only a little willingness is required to move from our fixed, unhelpful perspectives to those that bring peace of mind. It would have been understandable for Bill to retire once ACIM was finished, to rest on his academic laurels, congratulating himself for a job well done, and such a path would certainly have been deserved. But that was not to be his choice. So, fortified with a little willingness, Bill began to move away from his role of esteemed professor and to redefine his primary goal as the practice of forgiveness."

He had managed to keep her employed past the usual retirement age of sixty-five to finish the last Course details. Before they had contemplated its publication, Bill had applied for and been granted a six-month sabbatical to begin in July 1976. Through no intentional planning, the first edition of ACIM made its debut the month before, in June 1976. With the next stage of the Course’s history unfolding, coupled with the fact that it was a difficult time at the university in general, it was a great time to leave. Bill felt he simply could not stay at Columbia now that their “guilty secret,” as they called it, was out in the open, a potentially awkward situation for everyone else concerned, as well. (He did not specifically attempt to conceal or reveal his association with ACIM. Some colleagues found out about it through conversation or the few articles ultimately written about the work. Others may never have found out.) He had been through a ten-year, life-altering, spiritual overhaul, and to resume his work with traditional psychology as though nothing had happened, no matter how proficient he was, would have been an impossible backward step."

Finally, he found it too bizarre and contradictory to research the intricacies of how egos form and operate on one hand and to actively practice undoing them on the other. He abandoned his search. As Whit Whitson stated at Bill’s memorial service, “At the same time he was mapping the ego, he was channeling the process by which we could escape—like mapping an earthquake and then making a plan for how to get out of it.”[106]"

msgid "As his sabbatical was ending in early 1977, Bill took a leave of absence, then applied for another, but the second one was denied. He now had to make a final decision to stay or leave. He chose to leave. Because he had started at Columbia in February 1958, he was eligible for early retirement beginning in 1978. Thus, after beginning his sabbatical in mid 1976, he never returned to his academic or administrative duties. During that period of being employed but not actively working, he made several trips to California, at Judy’s invitation, to meet with groups about the Course. (Helen also participated in a few of them, although under protest because she strongly disliked traveling.) These trips planted the seed in Bill and introduced the possibility of leaving not only Columbia, but New York itself. The Skutches were entertaining the idea of moving to Tiburon because Judy planned to work on her Ph.D. in San Francisco and, additionally, she knew many people in the Bay area. Also, Jerry Jampolsky, a close friend of Judy’s, was a long-time resident of Tiburon. During those visits, Bill realized that both Jerry and Judy needed help with their personal lives and that living close to them would be ideal for offering his assistance. This provided a pivotal rationale for moving."

It was that branching of the road we all come to eventually and he chose the California path."

He notes his propensity for leaving finished eras behind. “I talked about it [the Course] when it was necessary and then I would leave. Probably a lot of my life has been that way. I do whatever I think is necessary at the time and then I withdraw from it all.”[107] In characteristic fashion, he abandoned his life, his career, the person he had been, like a suit of clothes left hanging in the closet.

Leaving New York was wrenching, even though he was following his excellent guidance in making the choice, the right and inevitable one for him. New York had been the center of Bill’s world even during his early days in Washington, D.C., when he frequently traveled there on weekends."

The article appeared in April 1977, and the response was overwhelming and widespread. What remained of the first five thousand sets of the Course, printed a year earlier with Reed Erickson’s generous donation, quickly sold out, requiring an immediate second printing. Thousands of letters and inquiries flooded in, indicating ACIM’s immense impact on those first readers. With the word out far and wide, Bill, for better or worse, would never again enjoy anonymity regarding his role in birthing the Course."

I was fascinated with this article, and when I read the Introduction to the text, something in me responded. I could feel the power, the truth, and life coming through the words. I ordered the books, and when I finally held the newly delivered, unopened package, I knew without question that this was my way home.

Second in importance only to raising my children, it became the most all-encompassing element in my life. In May 1978, on the last of Bill’s several cross-country trips to finalize his move from New York to Tiburon, our paths crossed in Denver, Colorado, my home at that time.

msgid "In the early spring of 1978, I received a brochure from the Association of Humanistic Psychology (as I was not a member, I had never before received a mailing from them, nor did I ever again) about their regional conference to be held in Denver, featuring the publisher of A Course In Miracles, Judith Skutch (Whitson). Most captivating of all, it stated that Bill Thetford would also be there, though not as a presenter. I was thrilled. By that time, I had been a devoted Course student for nine months. I loved it and would have gone to any lengths to meet anyone involved with ACIM, especially Bill or Helen. On the appointed evening, my husband Bob and I arrived at Regis College, the conference location, and were surprised to find folding chairs and a temporary stage set up outside, an ill-considered decision as May evenings in Colorado can be very cold; there had been no mention of an outdoor event in the brochure. We greatly enjoyed Judy’s spirited presentation, which confirmed that ACIM was, indeed, a world-class enterprise, despite no sign of Bill. Since it was growing colder by the minute and I had brought only a lightweight sweater, I left shortly before the end of the presentation and headed for the nearest building."

#: paragraph:508
msgid "On entering, I saw a tall, attractive man standing alone to one side of a large reception area and instantly knew it was Bill. And in that same instant, looking into those indescribable eyes, I felt an immediate and ancient recognition, a connection unlike any I had ever experienced before. The sense of familiarity I had felt with the Course was amplified severalfold on seeing him. I introduced myself, thanking him for all he had done to bring this marvelous work forward. In those delicious ten minutes before everyone else succumbed to the cold and came indoors, I had the opportunity to visit with him but, more important, to be in his powerful yet totally unassuming presence. Words fail here. He seemed to be a man with no mask, no pretense, nothing to hide, and no agenda to pursue, and he made no attempt to be impressive, or anything else, for that matter. He was simply present—a graceful, authentic human being, a rarity in my experience. As we spoke for those few minutes before the crowd discovered him, I was enchanted by his beautiful voice, although I cannot remember a word he said. Anyone fortunate enough to have heard Bill speak, especially in person, knows the healing quality of his lovely bass voice. After we shared a brief good-bye, I rode home in silence, spellbound and intensely moved by this instant heart-to-heart connection with a seeming “stranger.”"

msgid "Tiburon, California—a progressive, upscale community with gorgeous views of the Bay area, located across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco—was about to become Bill’s new home. Now fifty-five, he was only a few weeks away from beginning the California chapter of his life. Inwardly, he recognized there was really no choice about this move, although his ego mind was still ambivalent. Only later did I discover that his stop in Denver was on the last of several trips to California to finalize his moving plans."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:510
msgid "On one of his earlier visits to Tiburon, while out for his usual morning walk, Bill had unexpectedly met a recent acquaintance. He asked him if he knew of any apartments for rent, and the man told him one was available next door to him and that it had been vacant for a while, most unusual for the area. Bill looked at it, declared it perfect on all accounts, and made arrangements to move in. His new home was on, aptly named, Paradise Drive right across from Angel Island, paralleling the water’s edge with a stunning view of San Francisco Bay, and only a two-minute walk to Jerry Jampolsky’s home. Dr. Gerald Jampolsky, one of the first and most influential Course advocates, had founded the Center for Attitudinal Healing in Tiburon based on ACIM principles in 1975. Judy and Bob Skutch, also newly transplanted from New York, were a few houses on the other side of Jerry, so all were neighbors and only a short walk to charming downtown Tiburon."

msgstr ""

msgid "At the time, I didn’t pay much attention to the fact that I had experienced this inner prompting because that would be unscientific; I couldn’t acknowledge that. However, I did make note of it and thought it might be intuition so I could talk about it a little, but not too much. Yet I didn’t know what to do with it and I certainly couldn’t account for it. This was not the first time this sort of thing had happened to me, but was a major example and I couldn’t ignore it.[1]"

msgid "So here he was in June 1978 with a tabula rasa—a blank slate for a new chapter. Jules Finegold, a retired architect and one of Bill’s early California acquaintances who became a close friend and companion, was instrumental in getting him settled into his apartment, decorating it with the few possessions Bill had sent from New York. When Bill left for his West Coast adventure, he had relinquished most of what he owned, including a great many books and most of his music except his entire Mozart collection, which was very dear to him. And what he left behind was not a huge amount, as he was not particularly into accumulating worldly possessions. For the ten years I knew him, he seemed more an advocate of voluntary simplicity than consumerism. In addition to leaving possessions behind, he abruptly cut almost all ties with friends and acquaintances of many years, both professional and social, as if clearing the decks for the final challenge of his life: to fully and completely practice forgiveness. Jules provided a service of paramount importance, helping him become familiar with the day-to-day requirements of living in Tiburon, because the practical matters of life were definitely Bill’s short suit, especially in a strange setting."

msgid "Right away their friendship deepened and they discovered common interests. Jules and Bill settled into a pattern of helping to edit some of Jerry Jampolsky’s earlier books, a process that worked very well for all concerned. They also collaborated in editing a book of Helen’s poetry, but their prize project was extracting some of their favorite excerpts from ACIM, the most beautiful and poetic, to create the book, Choose Once Again.[2] This extensive editing occurred over a period of several years and, interwoven with his other interests and projects, gave Bill an important focus during this regrouping phase of his life."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:516
msgid "Bill often commented on the feeling of discontinuity between the various major chapters of his life. Many people feel that way when they take new jobs, end or begin marriages, or relocate to another city or country. It often seems, on settling into the new situation, that the old one was a faraway dream unrelated to the present. Happily, every moment is discontinuous from the one preceding it, always allowing us to make new choices about how to respond to current circumstances. Releasing past thoughts and concerns, and with it our stress, is essential, since indiscriminately allowing past programming to dictate our present approach to life is unsatisfactory at best and maddening at worst."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:517
msgid "During the summer of 1978, as Bill adjusted to his new environment, a tiny ACIM community was evolving in Denver. I was still in my “evangelical” period, enthusiastically studying the Course and attempting to persuade everyone I knew to check it out. Many would open the book but immediately decide it was too long, too “religious” in language, or too complicated. Eventually, fourteen people coalesced who were sufficiently interested in the material to meet regularly, so in August, a close friend and colleague, Jaison Kayn, and I began facilitating our first study group."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:518
msgid "Later that summer an acquaintance called to say that Bill and the Skutches had moved to Tiburon, California, a town I had never heard of. I mentally filed that away, and within a month Jaison unexpectedly announced he was going to Tiburon, of all places, for five weeks to study Aston Patterning, an integration of deep tissue work, massage, and movement education. He had been Rolfing for five years and was feeling a deep call to study this new work.[3] Little did he know the other reason he needed to go to Tiburon. With that new information, I could practically hear Bill’s voice in my mind calling, “Come out, come out,” encouraging a visit to Tiburon—a most peculiar experience to say the least. I could not imagine that he even remembered our short conversation, much less that it would ever continue. In fact, it seemed the most arrogant and preposterous thought I could possibly entertain, but it strongly persisted. I had always recognized my intuitive faculty, very helpful when I listened, but I didn’t always follow it; early conditioning prevailed. Yet this “call from Bill” was so strong I simply couldn’t ignore it. The internal turmoil was escalating. As a first step and not knowing where it would lead, I wrote a letter of introduction to Bill on Jaison’s behalf, hoping to arrange a meeting for them, and thanking him again for ACIM. Having no idea how to contact him, I sent the letter in care of the Foundation for Inner Peace and hoped for the best."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:519
msgid "Two weeks later, October 31, while I was getting my little boys ready for Halloween, the phone rang and to my astonishment, there was Bill. He had received my letter and said he would be delighted to meet with Jaison, and asked if would I be coming out also. It seemed he, too, had recognized something familiar, a common bond. Ken Wapnick has noted that, for Bill, leaving New York was like leaving a prison and it apparently took him no time at all to start exploring other relationship options. At first, as an habitual response, I declined the invitation; the next morning, however, after considerable reflection, I accepted the incredible gift being offered. Of course, I would go to Tiburon; I must surely have lost my mind to consider doing otherwise. Everyone but me was saying yes. Bob was supportive of the plan and Jaison insisted I go. Bob was not particularly interested in studying metaphysics, including ACIM, but he never interfered with my pursuits. Thus, in mid November 1978, watching the Rocky Mountains pass far below, I marveled that I was really flying to California with no agenda, simply following my own instincts and challenging old, entrenched ideas about what I could or could not do. It was a crucial lesson for me—coming to terms with buried self-doubt as well as old habits of taking care of the needs of others but not acknowledging my own. I was not always my own best advocate. Now I was actually acting on an intuitive urge, assuming I had a place to fill, rather than repressing it in favor of “playing it safe” or being polite. It seemed a big risk at the time, but everything had worked so well, and the logistics were so uncomplicated, that the trip had every hallmark of “destiny,” and it did turn out to be life-changing in many respects."

msgid "Jaison picked me up in Tiburon on a Thursday afternoon and took me to his friend’s home where I stayed. Happily, it was within walking distance of the “ACIM neighborhood” on Paradise Drive. We contacted Bill right away and he invited us to come to his apartment the next morning. We arrived at the appointed hour and I will never forget that encounter. His home felt like a sanctuary, the peaceful quarters of an old monk. Bill was tall, smiling, and in his uniform—a favorite blue crewneck sweater and levis; I’m quite short so as we embraced in a big hug, my head was on his chest. I could hear his heart, which seemed very loud and large—it was an indescribably rich and wonderful moment. I was thrilled to have a chance to spend more time in his wonderful presence—a word that will appear often in this book because no other fits."

He was immediately warm and friendly, giving me a big hug, and the first thing he said to me was, “Oh, a healer.” [At that time, Bill knew nothing about Jaison or his profession.] And it was like “Whoa!” He was just so conscious and so tuned into everything and had the appearance of not being. From that first meeting, we had a relationship. There was no building a relationship; it just started. I felt accepted immediately, without hesitation, and we were instant friends. That experience of his warm welcome will always be a profound and totally precious memory.[4]"

#: paragraph:523
msgid "From that first moment of reconnection, Bill and I both recognized we were old friends from some ancient time and place. We seemed to take up where we had left off, with a heartwarming degree of openness and lack of formality or pretense. He seemed very willing to include Jaison and me in his daily life, and a wonderful new chapter began to unfold for all three of us. We spent the rest of the morning at his apartment, then ambled down to Main Street for a four-hour lunch. When it was time to leave, Bill asked if we knew Jerry Jampolsky. We told him we did not and he said, “Well, you must meet Jerry,” so off we went to his office a short distance away. Jerry was still a practicing psychiatrist, and his next patient was fortuitously late, so the four of us gathered in his office for a half-hour visit. Again, I experienced that intense, rich feeling, sensing the “family” was reconvening after a long absence; this feeling was accentuated by a strong pressure in my heart area, another first in my experience. It is difficult to describe that day except to say it was quite breathtaking."

msgid "Bill and I were together most of the time over the next several days, with Jaison joining us as his schedule permitted. The adventure simply got better and better. Jerry kindly invited Jaison and me to join what I came to call the “first family” of the Course at their daily study/prayer group, almost always held at his home but occasionally at the Skutches’. At nine o’clock every morning, Jerry, Bill, Bob and Judy Skutch, Frances Vaughn, and Roger Walsh, the man she later married, would meet for about an hour to read a lesson, sit quietly to see how it might apply personally, and visit in an open and sharing way. (Frances and Roger are both distinguished in their respective fields of psychology and psychiatry and pioneers in the area of transpersonal psychology.) Of paramount importance was the feeling in the room, the feeling of people deeply caring about one another. Jaison and I were most grateful to be included, and for the next several years, every time either of us were there, we were invited to the meeting. That courtesy was also extended to Jules Finegold, Pat Hopkins, and a few others who did not live in Tiburon, when they were in town. (Pat became a regular participant later when she moved to Tiburon.)"

Judy is an effervescent, lively woman; Bob, her husband at the time and a man of fewer words, is engaging and supportive in a more subdued manner and still manages the business side of the Foundation for Inner Peace. As we became better acquainted that evening, Judy suddenly exclaimed, “I know why you’re here. After all his years in academia, Bill needs to be socialized; I bequeath you Bill!” What exactly that would entail, I wasn’t sure, but without doubt I was delighted with the assignment."

I can see the two of us, [she and I] played such a similar role. Layle [Luckett, who appears later in Bill’s life] got a little rhapsodic and commented on what a great older sister I was, and I said, “Whoa, he was eight years older than I.” She wrote back with a little smile sign and said, “It doesn’t matter, you were his older sister.” I never thought of it like that but I knew he was my assignment. It didn’t mean I was to control his life, only that I would be his safety net.[5]"

#: paragraph:528
msgid "As if carried on a tide of good fortune, I found myself the junior partner in this “big sister” enterprise and, as with Judy, Bill did seem lighter and more reassured when we were together. Judy and I never confided our sisterly conspiracy to him, nor do we know what he might have thought about our prescription for his “re-socialization,” but he did flourish during our times together. During his early days in California, Judy was still traveling, speaking extensively on behalf of ACIM, and was not in Tiburon on a regular basis. Thus, she welcomed anyone who could play a surrogate role and provide a stabilizing influence for Bill. He had spent decades operating at a frantic pace with his multifaceted work, including the time-consuming addition of the Course from 1965–1976. Considering all the upsets and opportunities for psychological growth that had occurred simultaneously with his workload at Columbia, Bill seriously did need to decompress, and if ever there was a project I could wholeheartedly embrace, it was this one. To say I felt richly blessed at the prospect of spending more time with Bill would be a major understatement."

He was as surprised as I was that he not only felt compelled to read it but to respond. He chose not to open his letters then because he didn’t want to deal with the inquiries or comments they may have contained; he was earnestly trying to dissociate himself from the Course. After I had spent some time with him, I realized how extraordinarily out of character it was for him to call me—and certainly to invite us to come out. Jaison and I were strangers and he was an intensely private man. I grew up in a socially active household with all sorts of activities—gatherings, houseguests, group meetings, celebratory meals—and it was entirely normal to invite persons we didn’t know well, along with friends, to join us. My adulthood in Denver mimicked my growing-up years, so his warm invitation didn’t seem odd, simply generous and altogether unexpected. Only later did I appreciate the leap of faith it took for him to call, just as it had been for me to respond. We were both being led into unfamiliar territory."

msgid "Having left Columbia only recently, Bill was reticent about openly acknowledging his connection to A Course In Miracles—the title itself sounded so peculiar and unscientific. He needed the security of a few close friends. Just as he had not come out as a homosexual, and never did officially, he had not yet come out of the ACIM “closet.” Certainly, other psychologists have been involved with “channeling” or have received material from unusual and unknown sources, but few had careers as auspicious as his. In addition to his reticence about associating with the Course, the radical shift from academic to ordinary citizen was a shock, and he was grieving over the end of the New York era. He wrote, “I thought it was amazing that I could see so clearly and yet the same thing [old ego patterns] kept coming up. I had to leave the whole New York ambiance and go to a totally different setting to begin to let go. It was very difficult for me to do that. I was so dedicated to working things out there [with Helen].”[7]"

Also, he was honoring Helen’s request not to publish the chronicle of the ACIM scribing or their personal histories until after her death, which occurred in February 1981. Ultimately, of course, Bill saw the wisdom of a complete account of how the Course was written and worked with Bob to ensure its accuracy."

msgid "Bill attributed his reticence about publicity partly to his clear remembrance of a former life as Origen, one of the greatest theologians and biblical scholars of the early church. Martyred around 254AD for his heretical posture on many basic church doctrines, he was the most influential theologian of the church before St. Augustine. ACIM students will find the mystical nature of Origen’s teachings strikingly familiar. Given the barbaric torture Origen endured for his beliefs, which probably hastened his death, Bill’s reluctance to expressing his views publicly may have been rooted in a bleed-through awareness of that traumatic time. Incidentally, Helen also tuned into this former experience of Bill’s. Once she suddenly interrupted discussion of an unrelated topic to disclose this former life to him, a confirmation he found both fascinating and illuminating. It was another of his favorite stories and he told it with his signature smile of amusement."

msgid "Early on in California, a coterie of people began to collect around Bill, all part of a grounding network vital to his continued unfolding, while mutually facilitating the healing for all concerned. The initial support group, consisting of Judy and Bob Skutch and Jerry Jampolsky, was already in place when Bill left New York. With the morning prayer group, Frances and Roger joined the circle and, along with Jules, became central to his anchoring into the area. With careers in psychology and psychiatry, they functioned as colleagues but also became his protégés. Additional members of Bill’s support group, from different places and walks of life, showed up throughout his last ten years in precisely the proper order. Those closest to him were all ACIM students and formed a family of sorts; each provided different yet essential elements for his releasing, healing, comforting, and grounding. The foundation was being laid. Bill had made a commitment to practice the Course’s version of forgiveness and help to do so was coalescing. Of course, he had many wonderful friends, colleagues, and partners during his first fifty-five years, but his goals then had been more worldly and divided; he had not yet fully dedicated himself to a spiritual practice. Additionally, many other friends and acquaintances were part of his California life, important in various ways, and who undoubtedly contributed to his well-being. The Course clearly states that there are no accidents—even the briefest encounter is meaningful and holds the possibility of great healing if we so choose. Nevertheless, Bill, like everyone, was destined to spend more time with some than others."

Sufficient financial support and anchoring into normal everyday life required attention. Bill was skilled in many ways and adept at negotiating the labyrinth of academic power, but he did not operate comfortably in ordinary daily life. He needed routine and support to function effectively in this world, to keep his feet planted on the earth. For instance, Bill had contributed to his TIAA-CREF retirement fund while at Columbia, but had forgotten to apply for his benefits when he retired. When Pat Hopkins (who entered his life later) found out about this in 1984 through a conversation with Cal Hatcher, she helped him apply for his benefits, significantly increasing his monthly income. Despite chairing a department with a large staff and sizable budget, he was quite detached when it came to personal finances. Jack Luckett corroborates:"

Now that means relating to food, clothing, directions, appliances, electronic gear, politics, gardening, animals, and children. He did not have a clue about these things. He was not comfortable with and did not understand the governmental political process. He was a great faker. Because of this, he would establish routines in his life, probably because he’d been laughed at earlier. When he found something that worked, he would stick with it, make a routine of it. He told me that for fifteen years, he ate at the same restaurant with the same waitress at the same table, ate the same meal every night, except when he was asked out by others. I said, “Didn’t you ever want to go to a different restaurant?” and he answered that, no, he knew this place, knew where it was. Can you imagine that?"

He went down and bought one year’s supply of the same kind of enchilada dinner and put them in the freezer.

This schedule continued for about three years. Early on, it felt surreal to watch him sitting on our patio, listen to his tales, or conversely, be included in his daily routine as he settled into California.

Although he had studied, tested, and written about children in his professional life, he had very little experience being around them in normal everyday life. As an adult, he was basically unfamiliar with families or the myriad details and responsibilities of family life. Bill would stand in the kitchen as I prepared meals, with little ones running in and out, and often exclaim, “I don’t know how you do all this!” It was business as usual; parents learn, out of necessity, to multitask. He himself was a master at multitasking but in very different areas of life."

He sat in wonder as he listened to their conversations, finding them hilarious and precious. He would look over at me with eyes wide open, a huge grin on his face, as their stories unfolded. Their parents would likely have been less than thrilled to hear their small children candidly revealing private family business.

He acknowledged the difference, then responded with a broad smile, “Nothing is ever going to get in his way in life!” In addition, both Bill and Helen were true Gilbert and Sullivan aficionados, and he was especially pleased that my older son had a significant role in his elementary school’s abridged production of the musical, H.M.S. Pinafore. Greg was nine, an age when Bill was still confined to bed, which led to more reminiscing about how different were their early childhood experiences."

Bill had an amazing capacity to seem at home in any situation even when he absolutely was not. These various groups of children took to him at once and all unquestioningly considered him part of their young lives, telling him their stories and competing with one another to hold his hands. Sometimes he read stories to our boys at night, which they loved; they regarded him as a favorite uncle, and in my mind I can still hear the sound of his reassuring, resonant voice coming down the hall."

Sometimes Bob joined us for an evening walk and remembered them fondly, “We just walked and talked and exchanged thoughts and information and he was always receptive to whatever was on your mind; he would listen to you. You could talk to Bill about anything and he would have an answer. Somehow the two of us clicked; he was just a dear, dear, friend.”1[15] Although Bob was not a Course student himself, he was a gracious host on Bill’s visits; he made sure he had everything he might want or need as a guest in our home.

He’d catch me up on the latest ‘craziness’ going on with the Course or what Jerry Jampolsky or other people were doing. But in a way, that was all window dressing. Behind it was a shared sense of presence and peace, just meditating together and sharing the moment.”[16] Hugh Prather also mentioned how they always seemed to be walking together somewhere, discussing a range of issues, and how important that was to him.

They were his favorite and, at first bite, became mine as well. Since we were both basically shy people, there was not much to say. We simply sat, watched, and enjoyed our cream puffs. We accepted each other’s shyness very easily and did not need to entertain each other. It was more than comfortable; our energies seemed to be quietly communicating something gracious and beyond words. I was probably one of the few people in his life he felt that way about.

On occasion, when we had our private space, he would break down and weep. I comforted him as best I could, at the same time encouraging him to cry those tears so long unshed—tears not so much over particulars, but a lifetime accumulation of pain not fully acknowledged. Nothing specific prompted those episodes; it was more a combination of things. We often spoke of his relationship with Helen, with the Course, and the heaviness he carried about it all—the burden of unexpressed life, repressed grief, hiding out. All of us hold onto some secrets, wearying at the very least, and this was especially so for Bill. He constantly lived a dual life: his academic career intermixed with his hidden ACIM work, his unresolved love/hate relationship with Helen, his knowledge of various secret CIA projects—very likely carried to his grave—and of course, his never publicly acknowledged homosexual private life.

We compared notes about my mother (also named Helen), who at that time was retreating into Alzheimer’s disease, and about “his” Helen. He said he had tried for so many years to make her happy, to do or be whatever she wanted, and that it was simply not possible. As simple as it sounds now, it was a significant breakthrough for him to realize it was not his job to make Helen happy, and he advised me accordingly.

In my experience, most people learn that being okay, being worthy, having a right to be here, is measured by others’ approval; unlearning that lie is essential and often a lifelong venture. He felt disappointed and betrayed because his vision of practicing the Course with Helen and having a wonderful friendship didn’t happen. He also felt some resentment that she had gotten him into this situation and was not fulfilling her part of the bargain, whatever he perceived that to be. At the same time, he was compassionate with her, aware of her difficulties when she was overtaken by phobias and compulsions.

msgid "Perhaps we should call forgiveness “Process X” to distinguish it from the misinformation we have learned. To paint a mental picture, imagine a thatch of many little twigs, sticks, and grass, like a bird’s nest or the roof of a building found in many parts of the world. The thatch, being tightly woven, is strong and impenetrable. All those little sticks and twigs, for our purposes, represent our incessant train of thoughts—judgments, future plans, grievances, regrets, defenses, learned behavior designed for our physical and psychological survival, worries, self-images, roles we play, and pictures about how life is supposed to be. This omnipresent complex of thoughts, to which we are seriously addicted, has become like a solid wall that seems to surround us, separating us from the direct experience of life in the moment. We “think” about life rather than experience it directly. A Course In Miracles, brilliantly conceived and crafted, is so lengthy because it presents a process for relinquishing these “twigs” rather than a body of material to be learned. We tightly clutch these interwoven thoughts, believing we need them to survive and flourish, and are rarely open-minded on the subject. “Strong and impenetrable” are wonderful attributes if you want to keep the rain out or the eggs in. However, they are a devastating liability if they impede experiencing the present moment, with its inherent joy, peace, insight, and reliable guidance."

msgid "The Course is designed for the overly active intellects of the Western world. It takes us through a process that systematically dismantles this barrier, allowing freedom and happiness to increase in our daily experience. Forgiveness, as ACIM defines it, untangles and removes this accumulated mental debris, the complicated mental filter through which we interact with the people and circumstances in our lives—the blocks to the awareness of Love’s presence. When we realize that forgiveness is about freeing ourselves from our self-made prison—one we steadily and unwittingly make ever more secure through ego-driven thought processes—and that it has nothing substantive to do with the “other,” then we can proceed to liberation with real determination and gratitude."

When inner conflict is gone, the outer experience of hassle disappears. Love becomes known through all things. This is the centerpiece of the Course and the heart of all universal metaphysical teachings."

As he grew more willing to explore—literally—we took him to Vail and Aspen, where we attended musical events, visited with friends, or drove up backwoods mountain roads and marveled at the gorgeous scenery. He had lived all his life in cities, inside academic institutions, and had virtually no exposure to the great outdoors, but with his usual adaptability he managed to fit right in on the hiking trails—although short ones, to be sure. We once took him through the Rocky Mountains over Independence Pass, the back way into Aspen and a thrill ride for even the most seasoned mountain travelers. He was awestruck with the scenic beauty and probably terrified, but he never let on. We always discussed potential travel plans with him to make sure they would not be too strenuous. He was a bit nervous at the outset of some of our mountain adventures, because of the high altitude and how that might affect his heart condition; however, he always sincerely wanted to go and we did, with no problem."

A mundane accounting of everyday life was richer by far than grand philosophical discussion. Occasionally, however, we did delve into the meaning of certain concepts. Early on, I asked him about a sentence in the text, “Forgiveness is not real unless it brings a healing to your brother and yourself.”[23] Since I was fairly new to the Course, there was much I didn’t yet comprehend, including the fact that intellectual understanding comes after the process of forgiveness and not before. Presuming everything was already clear to Bill, I asked him what it meant. He said he had no idea. I was floored and thought to myself, “What do you mean, you don’t know what this means?” I now realize that although he knew a tremendous amount about the Course, he still retained unhealed grievances that would necessarily cause blank areas or blind spots in his comprehension. When the mind is not clouded with grievances, everything becomes obvious and simple; ultimately, that sentence became perfectly clear."

I had a sense of my awareness becoming focused in a simple point, which moved up and up in a spiral and became disentangled from the workings of the mind. Suddenly there was no exclusive identification with anything. There was clear awareness without any sense of “Roger” or any separate-self sense. There was a sudden recognition that the experience of egolessness that I’d been reading about all this time, a state the Course had been trying to get me to experience, is actually not a loss of the ego. Rather, the experience of egolessness is the recognition that the ego never existed in the first place."

First, he mentioned his amazement that Helen was able to leave the original dictation alone, given her tendency to be a particularly ferocious editor. She thoroughly edited anything that came her way, even a personal note; to be able to leave the material unchanged was astonishing and completely out of character for her. At the beginning of the transmission, if she changed a word because she didn’t think it was the right one, she inevitably went back and reinstated it. As the work progressed, she could see the necessity of the exact wording and she specifically stated she didn’t want to intrude upon what was unfolding.

Bill’s oversight was a governing factor and he gave his imprimatur to all changes. In the beginning, the Author specifically charged Bill to be responsible for the editing choices (with the Author’s consent), as Helen still found the entire scribing and editing process too disturbing. Additional factors help explain the disjointed impression; Helen strongly resisted the scribing process in the beginning, and Ken noted she was always trying to impress Bill.

Even though the several versions now available are slightly different from the most recent edition of ACIM published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, any edition chosen will foster the necessary “unlearning” of the obstacles to peace of mind.

There was nothing pretentious or ostentatious about him, nor did he look for flaws or shortcomings; he just genuinely accepted us all. Looking back, none of us really knew what we were getting into.

I found no evidence from interviews or archival records that there was ever an important woman in his New York life other than Helen. That is not surprising since he always had a male partner while living there and Helen consumed almost all his attention, even during his personal time. It’s a wonder he had time for anything or anyone outside his work and preoccupation with her. One of his good friends characterized him as “ambiguously gay,” and Bill told Jo, his first and only girlfriend, that he considered himself bisexual even though he was not intimate with women. Others opined that he thought and interacted in the world like a straight man but conducted his private life as a gay man. In his high school essay, he wrote of constantly following his sister and her friends around and about his ongoing fascination with the opposite sex, a fascination that apparently continued into adulthood. In the California era, Bill was attracted to a few other women and with them he had the same intimate yet not intimate relationship he and I had as well. We have all been confounded at trying to explain what that relationship was like. Also Bill was concerned that his homosexuality might reflect negatively on ACIM, a sacred trust in his eyes, and spending time with women could provide “cover.” Bill cannot easily be categorized in terms of his private life and his ambivalence challenged him, too."

That surprising outburst got everyone’s attention. He seemed afraid of anger, his own and others, and like so many, defended himself against it. In my research I’ve found other instances when Bill displayed anger but I witnessed only that one occasion.

If someone had asked, “More of what?” I would have answered, “Everything in general and nothing in particular.” It was less about acquiring information and more about clarity—an insightful process. If I had a specific question or an unresolved issue, it was answered or resolved, but not through my effort.

This was a shocking invitation as I had been a Course student for only a year and a half. The Course does indeed present challenges, and this one raised the bar. Looking back, I can’t fathom all I didn’t know then, but somehow, by the end of the day, the seminar seemed to be a success and Bill was greatly relieved. He despised speaking before large groups. He thought a group of five or six was the perfect size; that he enjoyed. However, standing in front of a large group produced great anxiety for him. Not only was public speaking threatening to him, but for his first few years after retirement, he was still trying to avoid notoriety about the Course. His New York friends indicated that he always hated public speaking while living there too, relying on tranquilizers to get through what he considered an ordeal.

Jerry was skilled and experienced at letting events unfold, and I, of necessity, learned a tremendous amount from him. I had no choice but to listen carefully and trust I would know what to do next.

Since his name was common enough, we introduced him simply as Bill, a friend visiting from out of town and attending just that one night. The classes were long, from 7:30 to 10:00 and often beyond, with a break in the middle. Sure enough, suspecting he was not an ordinary Course student, people asked during the break, “Who is that guy, anyway?” We repeated our story that he was a friend visiting for a few days, which was accurate but incomplete. Sensing something unusual, they started to talk to him, and predictably, as he was drawn into conversation, the secret eventually came out, as he was unwilling to lie when the questions became more probing. He still didn’t participate outwardly in any way, however, even after being “discovered.” Class members asked questions but not of him.

Jerry even asked him if he wanted to be listed as a co-author, but Bill declined. He was still dodging the spotlight."

msgid "There was plenty on his plate besides writing. Just as his friends wanted to support and nurture him, Bill, in turn, was consistently and generously available for all his close friends, particularly Jerry. Being helpful to Jerry, who was going through some trying times, was a major reason for his moving to California. Years later, as he became less of a “project” for Bill, Jerry jokingly mused that he wasn’t sure if Bill had reduced his ministrations because he thought he had succeeded or because it was a hopeless task! Jerry knew perfectly well, of course, how much Bill cared for him."

For several months he also devoted time to being interviewed for a video history of ACIM, though that first attempt was never released commercially. A couple of years later, a BBC producer who was a friend of Judy’s directed the video, The Story of A Course In Miracles, which involved more time-consuming filming of Bill telling his story. He also had the daily nine o’clock meetings at Jerry’s, attended a weekly Course group, and had countless meetings with new people he met through Jerry or Judy."

Jerry was the quintessential Pied Piper, drawing people to Tiburon from all over; some were interested in learning about his center and some were intrigued with him. When I entered the scene, the center was three and a half years old and had already attracted major national publicity; its star was on the rise. And any household over which Judy presides is always a three-ring circus at the very least. The edition of New Realities magazine that first announced ACIM to the world also featured an interview with Judy:"

Skutch’s life in the 1970s can best be summarized as a typical day in her consciousness exploratorium salon in the Skutch’s large New York City apartment. In one room a motion picture is being screened to a group interested in biofeedback. In another are seekers deep in meditation training. In still another room a medical research meeting is in progress."

And at any given moment, one might find an Edgar Mitchell, a Swami Muktananda, or a Uri Geller on hand, not to mention the usual assortment of mediums, mystics, and scientists—or just friends of friends. To a first-time visitor, it seems a miracle that such a petite lady can keep all of this going at once, in addition to often serving her home-cooked dinners to those gathered.[36]"

When Judy and her current husband, William (Whit) Whitson, established their home, the Foundation functions were divided between their household and Bob Skutch’s. When Judy and Whit began overseeing the foreign-language translations of ACIM (eighteen have been published and six more are in process), with all the busyness and drama that involved, that comprised only one ring of the ongoing circus. Thus, Jerry and Judy, with their respective households and organizations, were responsible for legions of people—friends, family and extended family, the famous and unknown, movers and shakers of the consciousness movement, those who wanted to offer help, curiosity seekers, and more—streaming through Tiburon. They often included Bill in various activities, either to make sure he felt included and welcome in his new environs or because they sought his advice and counsel. He was one busy fellow. Judy’s daughter, Tammy, remembers:"

At the least, it was another way to spend quality time in each other’s company. We enjoyed socializing with others of the Tiburon group and, with Jules in charge, toured San Francisco or the more scenic, rural parts of Marin County. There was never a lack of interesting people to meet or things to do, but relating was what really mattered."

When other people, especially visiting dignitaries, were around, he might innocently refer to something only he and I knew about, making it impossible to keep a straight face if we made eye contact. Many of his friends also experienced his delightful, playful, and irreverent side, sharing with him a personal joke or watching as he wiggled his ears while looking very serious or proper (no one could figure out how he did that). He was more than willing to lighten things up when he decided someone was being overly serious or self-important."

In New York he had no need to drive and hadn’t owned a car for more than two decades. Therefore, if we went someplace farther afield than Tiburon and environs, someone else drove. When it was time to return to Denver, Jules usually would take Bill and me to the airport. As Jules waited, Bill always came to the gate and stayed with me until boarding time (this was long before heightened security measures), and he seemed genuinely sorry I was leaving. We were very close but that doesn’t imply the “specialness” that precludes closeness to others. Over the years, he had other treasured and important relationships as well. The Course states: “Under the Holy Spirit’s teaching all relationships are seen as total commitments, yet they do not conflict with one another in any way. Perfect faith in each one, for its ability to satisfy you completely, arises only from perfect faith in yourself.”[39]"

The entire process of receiving and typing the material—the discussions and arguments about its meaning and then the editing—forced Bill and Helen to focus on it continually. Even when not doing the lessons or studying, they were under its influence, and by the time I met Bill, much “unlearning” had occurred, though it wasn’t yet complete. He was becoming very clear and being with him always felt light and free, even when he was depressed. These “down” periods, when he entertained the preposterous notion that he didn’t have much to offer, didn’t keep others from enjoying his marvelous presence. He was a “work in progress,” still harboring some grievances, but his loving nature was always apparent, his light still shining through, and his help unfailingly available."

In fact, doing our best to be compassionate, open, and nonjudgmental is the point, recognizing that correction is not our job but loving is. Shortly after the scribing began, Bill was invited to a meeting on a subject he knew little about. For political reasons, those at the medical center felt it imperative that he attend, and he was most uncomfortable about the prospect. In an instance of synchronicity, Helen took down a passage he found extraordinarily helpful, just as it has been for many others since.

The day before his planned arrival, Jules called to say that Bill had had a serious bout of atrial fibrillation, a malfunction of the heart. We were devastated, first out of concern for his well-being, and second, because we were so looking forward to including him in what would probably have been his first truly “family Christmas” since his own early childhood."

He had called her earlier in the day to say he was not feeling quite up to par, a characteristic understatement, and asked if she would take him to the hospital when she finished work. His condition steadily worsened after her arrival and she called the paramedics. They required considerable time to stabilize his acutely dangerous condition, then they rushed him to the hospital by ambulance. No doubt, Pat saved his life. She later assumed the task of handling all paperwork related to insurance, medication, and the details of recovery, which, given his basic unfamiliarity with such matters, would have been more than overwhelming to him. She was literally a God-send."

Our Center for Creative Alternatives had teamed up with the Mile High Church of Religious Science in Denver to sponsor a workshop featuring Jerry and Hugh Prather in April 1982. We had a sellout crowd, and while planning that event, Jerry and I intuitively felt we had some joint work to do. Three weeks later, I went to Tiburon and we brainstormed about the nature of possible projects. For the next two years, Jerry and I worked closely together in a number of areas, which entailed frequent visits to Tiburon and ongoing contact with Bill. Thus, between 1978 and 1985, I was there many times."

Because his daily routine sounds so ordinary, it doesn’t convey the magic so many felt on being around him. Therefore, before continuing with the chronology of his earthly adventure, here are more details of his major positive characteristics and their life-altering impact on others, as well as the “demons” that plagued him—all the challenges, fears, and concerns that had to be forgiven."

Bill was highly regarded, widely known, and included in assorted “Who’s Who” lists of the academic world. As should be obvious by now, he was brilliant, erudite, painstakingly meticulous, sophisticated, dignified, and a great lover of music and theater. Those persons interviewed for this book added their assessments—gracious, courtly, a real gentleman, compassionate and encouraging, an impeccable man. He was also reserved, nonconfrontational, and rarely emotionally expressive. Catherine Prescott, a good friend, observed:"

And because he was so smart and sophisticated, his ability to be funny was on the leading edge of the bell curve.

He was courageous, having steadfastly continued with ACIM’s secret unfolding in the face of potential disgrace and loss of employment."

msgid "Bill was also private, shy, deliberately compartmentalized, and secretive, often keeping various relationships separate from other friends and colleagues. His ability to compartmentalize was ideal for someone who had worked for the CIA and held diverse positions at Columbia, especially for a gay man, given that our society was much less tolerant several decades ago. Incidentally, Bill would not have discussed his sexual preference even if he had been heterosexual, considering that déclasse and none of anyone’s business. He used to joke, “Keep your life a muddle and no one will ever know what’s going on.” In his reading in 1980, Leroy Zemke described a characteristic of the indigo blue color in Bill’s aura:"

That color indicates nobody gets through and that is between you and God. . . . You are not about to open yourself to the place where you’re almost going to be put on an operating table, to be taken apart piece by piece. This color represents your not wanting to share yourself with the world, or even with close or intimate friends.[2]"

msgstr ""

#: paragraph:703
msgid "Regarding his challenges, Bill could be depressed, ungrounded, restless, and argumentative; he required routine in order to function effectively in many areas of life. He could also display an edge when his passive aggressive nature was aroused and was perfectly capable of analyzing another’s ego, seeing what was inconsistent or unworkable. In the presence of loud or pushy people, whom he found distressing, he would “back up” emotionally. When upset, he could be uptight and not at all funny. Not knowing much about the world outside academia, he tended to observe life rather than fully participate in it. For the most part, I never personally experienced his “down” side, but to complete the picture, others’ experiences and observations deserve inclusion."

He felt the need for privacy at the human level and to keep secret his thoughts and actions, but he couldn’t hide his energetic presence. The unalterable truth of him, his loving reality, was always apparent. As part of his inclination to secrecy, he rarely expressed a strong personal opinion or commented on political issues or current events. I never heard anyone attempt a political or other controversial conversation with him. Jack Luckett shared his thoughts about Bill’s sense of patriotism: “He knew he was lucky to be born a white American male but he wasn’t sure about the gay part. We used to go to 4th of July celebrations in La Jolla, and when well done, he found them moving. I think sometimes he found my gung-ho Marine commitment amusing, but he admired it as well.”[3] His wife Layle added, “You knew Billy very well and know he was not passionate about much except opera and Mozart! I’d call him ‘neutral’ regarding patriotism. Certainly he was not a flag-waving, ‘America first’ kind of a guy, but he appreciated being born here. Maybe he was too removed from human ‘life-in-time [and space]’ to concern himself with feeling superior over his choice of birthplaces.”[4] Jack concluded, “Bill was as complex as a Chinese puzzle but had a strong desire just to be normal.”[5]"

These comments, for the most part, were offered by those who knew him in his post-Columbia years, and thus after he had been strongly influenced by the Course for more than a decade. ACIM was working on him even while he was working on it."

The point is not to learn how to get one’s way or acquire facts or strategies more effectively, but to unlearn our early programming. Some persons have labeled ACIM a mind-training course—indeed, it is and thank goodness for that! From birth, our minds are trained to believe in separation, self-absorption, and lack, not only through our families but through all our societal encounters—educational, political, religious, and through the media. That training—unhelpful and inaccurate but not necessarily deliberate—to regard ourselves as smaller and less deserving or important than we really are, must change if we hope to experience any peace of mind. The consistent practice of Course principles drives long-standing, limiting beliefs from our original mind training into conscious awareness, so we can decide whether to be bound by them or not. It’s as if we have all been born and raised in a cult, with the ego as the tyrannical leader, requiring absolute allegiance. Since we know of no other way of being, we presume this is the only way to live. ACIM acts as a “deprogrammer” for our ego-directed brainwashing."

Then there is another step-up of that color and it is mixed with a lot of white, indicating transformation through love, the capacity to transform people, life circumstances, through love, and this is the mark of a very advanced teacher or soul. Then still another color attached to this rose spectrum is a rose-white, a blend of the two so subtle that it seems more white than rose, and this indicates the connection to the divine that at times is so strong and so clear that there is no way you can translate that information in words. It is simply a transmission that occurs on an energy level of your being and gradually filters into form in whatever way is best. It happens without your doing anything about it consciously and is responsible for the attraction that people feel. Many of the people who experience this with you do not understand what they are experiencing. They just know they want to have it. They want to be near you, be around you, close to you.[9]"

msgid "If presence was a term universally ascribed to Bill, several noteworthy subsets derive from it. A sentence from Dante’s Paradiso succinctly captures so many people’s subjective experience of him: “You are my sire, said I: you give me heart freely to speak my thought: above myself you raise me.”[10] Or a more modern translation: “You give me full courage to speak; you lift me until I am more than myself.”[11] That was Bill, and it most fully articulates his greatest gift, the most noted aspect of his way of being—his unsurpassed capacity to support and accept almost anyone or anything. I say “almost,” because in his last decade there were still a few loose ends of forgiveness not yet handled and some persons could still push his buttons. Offering acceptance has a noticeable, substantive healing effect both on those who give and receive it. It speaks in ways far more compelling than words that we are not judged, that we are completely acceptable as we are and deeply cared for. Within the light of Bill’s acceptance, frantic or mindless thought could settle down, accompanied by a deep sense of relief. Imagine no need to defend, impress, convince, or dominate. People relaxed in his presence. Bill’s acceptance had the instantaneous, profound effect of orienting people to their own innate value, and the expansion was automatic. The Course speaks of the healing effect that practicing forgiveness has on others:"

And he will look on his forgiveness there, and with healed eyes will look beyond it to the innocence that he beholds in you. Here is the proof that he has never sinned, that nothing which his madness bid him do was ever done, or ever had effects of any kind.

That was interesting. He was also funny and cynical and made comments about everybody, including himself.

It’s as if he said, “If anyone needs permission to be themselves, I grant it,” only it wasn’t done at a conscious mind level. It happened automatically around him. If I had an issue, something I wanted to work on, he would say, “Why don’t you do that? Just change it all. Change it in your mind.” I went, “Oh, okay, why don’t I?” He was free and unattached to the whole thing, a very empowering person, not to overuse an old word. I found him to be equally loving to everybody. I think he loved a lot of us, his love was strong and that was very important. I never felt judged by Bill in any way, shape, or form.

Despite his outward demeanor and his obvious loving nature, he still had some long-held notions about himself to release. Bill may have been kind to others, but he was hard on himself, troubled by perceived deficiencies. It’s amazing that he could have had such a profound effect on others while still battling with his own guilt, testimony to the two starkly different modes of living in this world. Just as Helen could alternate between polar opposites—bowing to her difficult, demanding ego and accessing the love that created the Course—Bill, too, could operate from an unconditional loving space or be caught in the grip of self-doubt.

Second, throughout his life, Bill elicited certain behavior patterns in others, which allows great insight into what he feared or found troubling in himself, although perhaps unconsciously. “Unacceptable” behaviors in others, of course, reflect our own unfinished business and condemnation of ourselves. Third, he specifically commented on certain characteristics he found objectionable in himself and others; no detective work required here."

In addition to the potential embarrassment to the scribes, the Author specifically stated it should not be included. It is important for both new and seasoned students to realize the Author requested that specific or personal material be removed to avoid confusion, rather than thinking this was done unilaterally by Helen, Bill, or Ken. Where she had a personal investment, Helen did interfere to a degree, contaminating some of the very earliest material (and only the earliest) with her own biases, because she was not yet a totally clear channel. Such material was inconsistent with the actual Course, and Ken referred to these parts as “Helen-isms.” The scribing was very informal, especially in the beginning; the form was not sacrosanct. Ken Wapnick writes in an unpublished manuscript, “The History of the Manuscripts of A Course In Miracles”:"

msgstr ""

#: paragraph:743
msgid "In another sense, however, the situation is unfortunate because people could be misled and at this point, nothing can be done about it . . . except, perhaps, to clarify what inquiring students may be reading. Let me cite some examples. There is material in the Urtext about sex and sexuality, an area that will almost certainly pique the curiosity (if not prurient interest) of students. Thus, for example, one will read that homosexuality is essentially a pathology (the traditional psychoanalytic view) and that the only purpose for sex is procreation, two positions that are antithetical to Jesus’ own teachings in the Course about seeing all forms of the ego’s world as the same, the correction to the ego’s first law of chaos that there is a hierarchy of illusion. To believe that these would be the words and thoughts of Jesus is as preposterous and unthinkable an idea as to believe that I could influence Helen as to what belonged in the Course and what did not. It should be obvious that these beliefs belong to Helen and not to Jesus. Helen had her own biases about sex, and unfortunately they came through in these early passages. Yet those who believe that every word in the Urtext is sacred and are Jesus’ words can use statements like these to support their own preconceived notions. This same issue holds, though perhaps with less emotionality, with material related to Edgar Cayce, Freud and other psychologists. . . ."

msgid "Thus, it became very clear to me in the years I knew Helen that I should take with a grain of salt some of the things she said or wrote as coming from Jesus, and this clearly included the early Urtext material. Unfortunately, there are also some things there that if you do not know the context, you will not understand what they refer to, or what they mean. This inevitability means that those who were not present and did not know Helen and Bill will misunderstand much of what is found there.[22]"

Bill often commented on how difficult scribing the Course was for both of them; being thoroughly examined by the Author makes “difficult” seem, at the least, an understatement. Both Bill and Helen called on considerable courage to continue their scribal commitment while being in the “hot seat” with the Author."

(By the way, Ken indicated that the quotes I have chosen for inclusion in this book are valid, not ones where Helen’s personal opinions bled through.) Despite his outer success, Bill still harbored resentments and was plagued by a lack of self-worth. Sound familiar? The following material comes from the early part of the Urtext, which was deleted from the first six chapters of the published text.

msgid "One of Bill’s gifts was a presence that enabled people to grow. He was very accepting. He never tried to impose his own views on anybody. I would describe his way of being as an absence of personality noise. He created a safe place for people to be who they were. He was definitely very attentive to whomever he was with; it was as though he didn’t need to take up any room. By making a space for you to fill up, he made you feel that you could just be who you are."

msgid "When I talked to Bill I felt he really listened and could understand what I had to say. That was one of the nicest things about him. He wasn’t full of his own agenda or ideas about the way things should be. He provided a spaciousness and a quality of listening that was very deep. I felt he gave loving, non-interfering attention to everyone. That is a great gift that can be very healing.[34]"

msgid "These observations include several critically important ideas. First, we all know individuals who take up a great deal of psychic space, who seem to take all the air out of a room, who dominate with “I, me, and mine—it’s all about me.” No one warms to that person and yet we all believe that we require some degree of self-promotion to be happy, secure, and prosperous. However, if you ask someone to elaborate on how that happens, you will not get a valid answer. We have fallen into the trap of believing that taking up space is good and necessary, competing for it through attempts to be special. The philosopher Douglas Harding often speaks of “disappearing in favor of the other person,” another way of stating Bill’s capacity for open acceptance. It seems a paradox that the more wholeheartedly present we are for others, the more we “disappear,” the more everyone gains. This contradicts our earliest programming of how to “stake out our territory.” If we gathered up all the “I, me, and mine” thought patterns and rolled them up to almost nothing—figuratively speaking—our happiness would increase. Focusing on the other, rather than self, is a major component of forgiveness. One caution: taking up no space does not mean withholding, hiding, or defending. Keeping things bottled up for fear of being unacceptable is hardly a no-space situation. Feeling inferior with the need to hide can result in one’s being an irritable, high-maintenance person, indeed."

#: paragraph:784
msgid "A second important aspect of the acceptance Bill demonstrated was his capacity to listen fully, to give another his undivided attention regardless of the subject matter; this is healing for both parties. The one being listened to feels completely and unconditionally accepted, and it quiets the mind of the listener, bringing both into the present moment—the only time a change of mind can occur. Undivided attention also clears the mind enough so that guidance or intuition about what to do or how to change perspective becomes possible. Counterintuitively, “taking up no space” incurs no sacrifice whatsoever. ACIM, understanding that we believe this change of outlook is dangerous, states:"

Wherever this renewal process begins, it is because even one or two individuals are willing to allow changes in their perception of each other and the world. They are not perfect, but they consistently seek to suspend judgment, see another’s interests as not separate from their own, and forgive.

I doubt that Bill was ever fully aware of the power that his willingness and commitment gave him, but I was only one of many recipients of the fruits of his labor. For one moment he suspended all prejudice, judgment, and expectations of me, providing a mirror unclouded by egoic perceptions and needs. In that clear mirror he showed me Who I really am—and opened the door to the way home.

Catherine Prescott remembers, “We used to talk about yielding, about how there was the tendency of his ego to yield to whatever power was in his space. . . . But what was underneath that was his guilt about being alive when his sister had died so young. And so he just became smaller rather than bigger. It was like he thought if he could just make himself small, then it was okay for him to be alive. He admitted to being deeply traumatized by her death.”[59]"

We come into form with our inclinations already intact, and conditioning commences at birth and even before. Most of us learn at a very young age to be afraid of “being seen” or of others discovering what we’re really like, so we fortify our defenses, the prime one being the mask we hide behind. Hiding convinces us we really do need to hide, as if our survival depends on it, and we are not open-minded about this. It is crucial to look directly at what we fear is wrong with us because this fear is nothing more than one end of the spectrum of beliefs we hold about ourselves. Those beliefs, both positive and negative, collectively constitute the ego, which is a convenient verbal handle for what ACIM is designed to address. The Course states clearly that everything true about us is completely loving and harmless. As this material poured forth, exposing their defenses, one can imagine Bill and Helen’s shock; did they ever wonder why they had ever asked for a better way?"

Since relationships with others reveal the relationship we have with ourselves, the hassles he experienced in New York and beyond clearly pointed to fears and expectations about what he thought he deserved, though perhaps unconsciously. Every “difficult person” in his life was a red flag pointing to his own self-condemnation, mirroring judgments he may have been unaware of, or unwilling to face. They sat there, staring back at him, each representing some facet of his guilt. What we complain about in others always indicates what we need to own in ourselves."

Certainly, no one can coerce anyone in any way unless all parties cooperate in that process. From his perspective, he felt he was told who he was rather than allowing that to reveal itself and also that there were agendas and expectations about his having to be a certain way. Of course, these merely revealed his own expectations and agendas for himself, which at times he conveniently forgot. His anger about not being accepted for who he was provides a specific clue about his own failure to accept himself. Who has not engaged in that behavior somewhere along the way? “Whenever you consent to suffer pain, to be deprived, unfairly treated or in need of anything, you but accuse your brother of attack upon God’s Son.”[64] ACIM never lets us off the hook, always bringing all our distress back to our own self-attack."

He was clear that ACIM is basically a self-study course and did not like the idea of churches or organizations being formed to promote it. This has, indeed, occurred, rendering an important service to many. He continued to shift his position on this, however, recognizing that so long as he was attached to its being used a certain way, he wasn’t learning his lesson. Despite his private concerns, he never advocated preventing the varied uses made of it or fighting something already implemented, trusting that there are no mistakes and that learning can come from any situation. By the end of his life, he was very accepting of anything done with the Course, realizing it now had a life of its own and couldn’t possibly be contained.

Their effect was healing—of body and spirit—both for Bill and those around him. There was often no conscious discussion of or focus on healing; it just happened. For some, it was merely being in his presence, for others it was hearing his voice; but in other cases, he intended for healing to occur. He never stated directly what he thought ought to be healed in a person. Layle Luckett remembers, “One thing I learned about myself during that process is that there is a wonderful indirect way of teaching [and healing].

Healing the body is never the direct focus of ACIM. “Come to the holy instant and be healed, for nothing that is there received is left behind on your returning to the world.

Not only did Bill’s change of mind affect him but also those he was with. He recognized the Course was about both teaching and healing, but the healing part was more attractive to him than the teaching.

When one looks closely, we see this as a restatement of removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence. And like the Course, silence and stillness of mind is a prerequisite.

If an unhealed healer is a theologian, for example, he may begin with the premise, “I am a miserable sinner, and so are you.” If he is a psychotherapist, he is more likely to start with the equally incredible belief that attack is real for both himself and the patient, but that it does not matter for either of them. . . ."

I expected someone who was the authority, but he was very open about his confusions and doubts. Everybody assumed he knew everything, but he was just another guy trying to figure life out. Sometimes he was the opposite of the guy with all the answers and would get that look in his eyes like, “I haven’t got a clue, don’t ask me.” He would defer as much as possible, put everybody else in the middle of things and have them speak because he didn’t want to be the center of attention. He didn’t want to be the big cheese at all, but when he spoke, everyone listened.

msgid "Within a week, to the astonishment of her office staff, Bill had an appointment with the “impossible to meet” Mrs. Garrett and was amazed that it had been so simple. His next hurdle was to induce Helen to go with him to meet Garrett. She panicked at the idea of seeing her and discussing dissociated states, but ultimately he succeeded in, as he called it, “dragging her down there [to Garrett’s office].”"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:964
msgid "When Bill and Helen met with Mrs. Garrett, she was gracious, charming, calm, and very reassuring to Helen, calling her a “fragile little flower” and indicating that she (Eileen) needed no details about the manuscript they referred to, but that she would publish whatever they had taken down because of its source. In her mind, there was no question about its authenticity. Bill said her most important comment was that “if we went in the direction of the Course, if we followed it in our personal lives, we would both be gloriously happy, but if we fought it, we would be sick. She repeated that. It was obvious that she saw something about the character of the Course even then in 1968.”[110] Bill believed she was the greatest living psychic, and for her to confirm its legitimacy and to repeatedly emphasize the need to practice it made a strong impression on him. He was deeply reassured because he and Helen could talk to so few people about their extraordinary project. In retrospect, their meeting Eileen seems destined, just as was mine with Bill and the process was so similar. We cannot avoid meeting those who are to be in our lives, no matter how convoluted the process of our coming together may seem."

#: paragraph:965
msgid "Another confirming experience for Bill occurred in London and involved the famous English psychic, Ronald Beasley. Beasley read auras, the energy field that we are and emanate. He commented that Bill’s and Helen’s auras were remarkably similar, a very unusual situation, and told them personal information he could not have known, which they found most impressive. Beasley concluded by saying they were wasting their time, “You shouldn’t be involved in the university life; you should be involved in healing.”[111]"

msgid "Since the Course was clearly about both healing and teaching, Bill sought more information about unusual healing practices, just as he investigated various mystical traditions. He had watched Kathryn Kuhlman, a widely known faith healer, on TV and thought she was a bit hysterical but sincere, prompting him to seek her out. They managed to acquire front-row tickets for one of her events in New York and were captivated at seeing her in action up close. Bill recounts:"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:967
msgid "It was a highly charged emotional atmosphere. At the beginning, Kathryn came out on stage and went through a warm-up period. She was really coquettish and, to my mind, inappropriate, especially for her age. She wore a white dress and made little jokes, gradually warming up her audience. This went on for a while, then gradually something began to happen. She became more serious and started talking about the power of spirit. I was aware of the moment when things clicked—changed. She became quite different, another consciousness had taken over. That was presumably what she was waiting for. It takes enormous courage to get up before thousands of people and wait for that to happen. When it happened, there was a feeling of authenticity about it. She was no longer this sort of silly, somewhat hysterical woman, but a power and spirit that somehow came through. When she started calling out healings in various parts of the audience, people would come down and line up. It was amazing; she would just touch people and they would fall over. This went on for hours. Time didn’t seem to make any difference. None of it seemed contrived; it was all quite startling. Some of it may have been suggestion, but I don’t think it was all suggestion. It’s easy to dismiss this kind of thing, but Helen was very moved by it, too. Helen even dropped all of her blasé defensiveness, and I was very touched. We felt a tremendous spiritual power that was generated somehow. Kathryn was acting as a common battery, I guess; she was the focal point of this energy. It was very, very impressive. It went on all day, so by the time we left I felt both exhilarated and drained.[112]"

msgid "If Bill sought out-of-the-ordinary experiences, the reverse was also true. Cal Hatcher, Bill’s confidant as the Course was being scribed, recalled an incident. “Father Ben” in this tale was Bill’s graduate student who arranged the first meeting between Helen, Bill, and Ken Wapnick."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:969
msgid "Ben had come up to Columbia and taken his doctorate under Bill in psychology. Ben was confessing to Cardinal Cook. He was a character to me, and would come up there in his long brown robes with his cross swinging on him. My office was on the first floor at Columbia Presbyterian [Hospital] and sometimes he’d throw little pebbles at the window to get my attention. One day he came by and was throwing pebbles. There was a little concrete ledge there and an iron fence all around the office building I was in. I raised the window and Father Ben was standing out there with these two ladies in habits, nuns. He said, “I want you to meet a friend of mine.” I invited them to come in to talk. “We don’t have time,” he said, “but this is Mother Teresa and this is sister So-and-So.” Well, I didn’t know who Mother Teresa was, but my assistant, who was Catholic, said to me, “You dim-witted Protestant, you wouldn’t know anything.” So Mother Teresa was there. She was short, and so was standing up on the concrete ledge with the other sister. We were just talking back and forth, and they were on their way to see Bill and Helen. The famous Mother Teresa from India was on her way to visit Bill and Helen! [113]"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:970
msgid "Bill said that while they were transcribing the Course, he had prayed that he might meet a living teacher, someone who embodied these teachings of love. He had been “led” to a book about Mother Teresa, and shortly after, circumstances conspired to facilitate a meeting with her. She was then establishing a branch of her order in the South Bronx, the worst of all crime-ridden poverty areas in New York. He was invited to meet her there and of that invitation, Bill said,"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:971
msgid "Initially, I felt apprehensive about actually having my prayers answered, since I was not sure that I was up to meeting a living saint. However, when this tiny woman graciously met us with palms extended, I felt an almost instantaneous sense of relief. It seemed as if I had always known her. Completely selfless and without pretense, she radiated the joy of total spiritual commitment. Later, when she turned to me and said, “Doctor, wouldn’t you like to come to India? There is so much you could do to help the poor,” I felt an almost irresistible impulse to answer, “Yes!” . . . To me, her life is a demonstration of the importance of total dedication and complete consistency on the spiritual path.[114]"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:972
msgid "Later, she came to see Bill and Helen; they visited on more than one occasion. As Tammy Cohen conducted interviews about Bill and the Course et al. in the mid 1990s, several would begin a sentence with, “Bill was no saint, but . . .” and proceed to comment on his gentle ways, his generosity of spirit, or his refusal to indulge in character assassination. Those I interviewed or others who knew him in California never included the initial qualifying phrase, but mentioned only his positive traits. His westward move proved to be a specific line of demarcation in how most people saw him. It also marks that time when, perhaps guided by the several meetings he had with Mother Teresa, he lived more and more that “total dedication and complete consistency.” Years later, Roger Walsh commented,"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:973
msgid "There will doubtless be mythologies that try to make a saint out of Bill and perhaps other Course founders. If we mean by “saint” someone who has resolved all their psychological and spiritual difficulties, then Bill was certainly no saint and never pretended to be. However, he was someone who worked as hard as possible to have a full spiritual life. Perhaps, in the end, that’s a more realistic view of what a saint is. But labels aside, Bill was clearly a model of sincerity and integrity, and who can even guess how many millions of people his life will touch?[115]"

He had a very powerful intuition and sometimes he would balk. He would open the door and just say no, he wasn’t going. We knew not to push. For sure, when he said he wouldn’t go, we should have stopped in our tracks, because it would be the worst play you ever saw.[116]"

msgid "His close associates knew about his inner inquiry for any decision, large or small. When anyone made a request that he felt was not for him, Bill usually modeled the ideal response, simply saying, “No, that doesn’t work for me,” with no need to justify, explain, or make excuses. He made it clear there was nothing personal in refusing, it was simply his guidance."

#: paragraph:977
msgid "Another legendary talent was Bill’s ability to get tickets to any event he chose. Stories abound about all the times he showed up at an opera, play, or other special event, and someone would always sell or give him a ticket(s). Almost everyone who knew him well observed this remarkable skill in action—and it was a very specific action. He never had subscriptions to the Metropolitan Opera while he lived in New York but always attended whatever he wanted. He was likely to note that at 7:12 p.m. it would be time to go to the box office to get tickets. He always seemed to have a precise sense about when to go on his ticket-acquiring quest; and he wouldn’t get just any tickets but the ones he preferred. As with all of us, the more something happens, the more we trust the process and the more frequently it occurs."

#: paragraph:979
msgid "The highlight of the trip for both of us, however, was hearing Jessye Norman sing her Metropolitan Opera debut in Berlioz’s Les Troyens. Bill worked the magic he was famous for among his friends by somehow managing to obtain center-aisle orchestra seats to a sold-out performance. No matter how popular the event, or how long he waited to purchase the tickets, I never saw Bill fail to get excellent seats for anything he wanted to hear or see, anytime he wanted to go. It was absolutely amazing! He used to tell me it was God’s reward for being willing to help bring the Course though. Even though he always laughed when he said this, I’m not at all sure he was joking."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:980
msgid "On that particular occasion, we had been sitting in our hotel room reading the morning newspaper when Bill suddenly said, “I think we should go down to Lincoln Center about 2:30 this afternoon and look around.” Not a word was said about opera tickets—we already knew there were none available—and Bill was never one to state the obvious. So we had some lunch and went down to Lincoln Center a little before two. We strolled around looking at the Chagall murals and some photographs and musical scores on display in the opera hall. I didn’t even realize Bill was gone until I turned around at one point to say something to him and saw him walking toward me from across the room. He had a gleeful expression on his face and I knew that he had done it again. Sure enough, in his hand were two center-aisle orchestra tickets for that evening’s performance. It was a thrilling performance! . . . I remember looking at Bill during a particularly moving aria and realizing we were both in a kind of altered state. It was a transcendent, joyful occasion, one I’ll never forget.[117]"

msgid "Another example involved Ice Capades tickets. Jack Luckett had bought three tickets sometime in advance of a particular performance, only to find they would be out of town. He gave them to Bill, who then invited a couple to go with him. As it turned out, another friend was going to be in town at that time and Bill invited him also. His initial invitee reminded Bill that he had only three tickets, but he reassured him that was no problem, all four would go. Jack recounts:"

msgid "They drove to the sports arena with only three tickets. There were thousands of people surrounding this place, and they were walking across the parking lot when a man on a bicycle comes riding toward them, riding through all the people, through all the cars and right up to them. . . . Bill said, “Do you have a ticket for me?” And the guy answered, “Yes.” Bill asked him how much it was and the man mentioned an amount. Bill reached into his side coat pocket and pulled out the money and handed it to him—the exact amount. It was not the amount of the ticket, but to the dollar, he had the amount the guy was asking for the ticket. As he handed it to him, he said, “Thank you, I was waiting for this,” put the ticket in his pocket, and they went in. As it turned out, this fourth seat was very close to where they were sitting in that huge sports arena.[118]"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:983
msgid "Though it may sound trivial, the same dynamic applied to parking spaces. Ease in finding parking spaces per se is hardly cause for celebration, but the state of mind it reveals is. I was with Bill more than once when we needed to find a space in a very crowded area. As we approached, I would suggest we start looking and Bill would say, “No, there’ll be a parking space waiting.” One time near a crowded plaza, a vacant spot appeared right across from our destination—it was as if it was invisible to all the others looking for one. That often occurred for Bill; he was intuitive and open to such things and took great delight in their happening. Although he knew very well that miracles arise from a miraculous state of mind, he wasn’t always there; he wasn’t constant. But when he knew he was “on,” it always worked. Hugh remembers,"

msgid "And yet he didn’t think he’d led a charmed life or had special powers and was just as aware when things didn’t work out. It’s not like he thought there was someone making everything smooth for him. He did not subscribe to a race of chosen ones, and the whole subject of manifesting—that somehow our spiritual path gives us powers ordinary mortals don’t have—whereby the Holy Spirit opens personal doors so you get the right job, the right car, money, success, and parking spaces was immensely amusing to him. We shared a tremendous amount of humor about all this . . . and he delighted in talking about it. It was part of his open-mindedness. Despite his being somewhat cynical about our personal ability to manipulate the world, he was completely open to psychic phenomena that show the unreality of the world, which is not quite the same thing.[119]"
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:985
msgid "If intuition worked while he was “on” and not at other times, he was very happy that Helen’s intuition was not always reliable. One unusual challenge that weighed on him in his first years away from New York was Helen’s prediction, made around the time ACIM was first published, about when both she and Bill would die; she saw the date on her own tombstone (she was off by a year) and indicated Bill would follow her within a year of her passing. Since she had died in February 1981, everyone, certainly Bill, felt some apprehension as the anniversary date approached. It came and went without incident, and everyone let out a collective sigh of relief; Bill survived Helen by seven and a half years. Ken Wapnick has noted she could be notoriously wrong when she had a personal investment in a prediction. That was her psychic facility misfiring, rather than the Voice that authored ACIM. Only with nonspecific, nonpersonal Course material was she always absolutely clear."

#: paragraph:986
msgid "Even though Bill had followed his guidance or intuition about moving to Tiburon, that didn’t imply his time there would be the proverbial bed of roses. It was simply the locale for his next round of inner growth and releasing defenses. He mused, “I guess too, sometimes, we also really have to go to the ultimate despair in order to break through; at least I do. It seems to be the way it went, and that may be the only way I can learn. I felt I had to struggle with everything, including the Course. It was very hard to be on this path without the notion of struggle, which seemed so predominant, but I loosened up a bit.”[120] All learning isn’t difficult or painful of necessity, only resistance makes it seem so. Along with the more challenging situations, Bill also had some wonderful, happy times in Tiburon."

Pat remembers from that time, “Sometimes I would join him and Jules for dinner and our conversation would continue through the evening hours. It was obvious that our friendship was becoming more intimate, but it did not feel like falling-in-love romance. Rather, it was more a recognition of something I do not know how to describe, something that gave us both comfort and a deep sense of kinship.”[1]"

msgid "I find it fascinating that so many people referred to that feeling with Bill; they variously likened it to a sense of kinship, being part of a family, an indescribable connection, recognizing an old friend or even one’s self, or a feeling of coming Home—nothing words can accurately convey. Incidentally, it’s reassuring to know that no matter who you’re with, the feeling of “being included in the family” increases as you practice forgiveness."

#: paragraph:1111
msgid "In late spring, Bill suggested they become housemates. Pat had a long daily commute to Tiburon from Santa Rosa, her home at the time, and Bill recognized his need for companionship, so for both practical and emotional reasons it seemed a perfect fit. From a broader perspective, it was also a perfect opportunity for both of them to continue to acknowledge some unfinished issues and to choose to let them go. The Course is crystal clear that the purpose of all relationships is our healing, whether we ever come to that awareness or not, and this one was no exception."

msgid "Pat and Bill had much in common. They both loved classical music—Mozart for Bill and a more balanced repertoire for Pat—and it was the centerpiece of their respective lives, second in importance only to their spiritual practice. Both were also very bright, intellectually gifted, and loved reading and discussing what they read, including much mystical and spiritual literature. They also shared a common sense of the absurd and had many a good laugh over the local “soap operas” within their community. As a primary focus from 1982–1985, Bill, Pat, and Jerry spent a great deal of time together writing Good-bye to Guilt, attending the daily 9 a.m. meetings, interacting with their friends whose common bond was the Course, and attending to the business of the Center for Attitudinal Healing. All three were on its board of directors. During times when not serving on the board, Pat was a consultant to the center and later a temporary acting director. She also helped Jerry establish an ancillary organization, the Foundation for Spiritual Alternatives, so as she said, she was the “ham in the Bill/Jerry sandwich.”"

I also found a certificate that the War Department presented to me for my work on the atomic bomb, as well as some scattered personal notes from the Course that Helen and I had taken out. There were also some old birthday cards that Helen had written and pictures of both my parents. It was a review of “This Is Your Life” going back to the middle 1940s, all jammed in a box. I found my reaction very strange. I was sad and obviously had resistance to looking. I threw out a lot of it in preparation for the move. So in cleaning house, I reviewed all the madness that one accumulates. . . . House cleaning is good, but I have the feeling that there is something that I don’t want to look at or something is missing.[2]"

#: paragraph:1115
msgid "In his relationship with Pat, Bill would continue that housecleaning, moving yet another step toward his liberation. Despite all they had in common and their great admiration for one another, Pat indicated that “nevertheless, living together did not always go smoothly for us” and that their time together was “the best of times and the worst of times, to quote Dickens.”[3] This is exactly what one might expect from a relationship so important to their mutual growth. I’ve always thought we learn our lessons with our closest friends, who agree at some level to be the mirror to our own fears, though at the time it can feel decidedly unfriendly. The people we live with provide the setup for deep and essential work, if we choose. Bill followed his own unique path to waking up as he built and maintained various relationships throughout his life that delivered exactly what he was willing to deal with at any given moment. The introduction to the Course text says, “Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time.”[4] We do have to unlearn our fear and guilt. We can drag our feet or dedicate ourselves in a cooperative manner to discovering those beliefs masking as truths. Clearly, Bill and Pat’s relationship had the same purpose: mutual healing, regardless of whatever reasons or needs seemed to draw them together. Bob Howe recalled, “I remember sitting down there in his condominium when Pat was living with him and they were arguing about which way the toilet paper should be on the holder. And the paper towels. Each one had their own inner secrecy and you kinda knew they had their own thoughts, their own way of doing what they wanted to do, and how they wanted to do it.”[5] They were perfect companions for the work at hand, and their time together was an essential part of his curriculum (and hers), a releasing, clearing, and burning away of old grievances and outworn beliefs. Regarding that curriculum, Pat reminisces:"

msgid "As the surviving co-scribe of the Course, I believe Bill felt an enormous responsibility, I would almost call it a burden, to be both modest, which was his nature, and to do everything he could to live and exemplify it. I still feel that Bill felt very strongly that he was holding the iconic, the symbolic, essence of the Course after Helen died. While he did extraordinarily well with not being inflated by those projections, I think he still felt them. At times, I felt this cost him enormously in terms of his own personal life; he was very divided between a fulfilled personal life and what he felt he needed to be for the Course, putting certain constraints on our relationship, as well."

Pat and Bill were standing in the kitchen of his apartment and I was close by in the adjacent dining nook. All of a sudden the room was filled with soft rose-pink energy. I saw it everywhere and felt it inside myself, as well. It was astounding! Fortunately, I had had an experience of this just the week before and knew what it meant. It was the presence of love urging us to open to expansion. Before I could stop myself, I felt the energy move me into the room and open my mouth. I started telling Bill to trust getting closer to Pat, which for me was—well, I never say things like that. I could feel this sweet rose-energy presence saying to them, “You have something important to do together.” Bill was clearly nervous and upset. I think he felt inadequate and overwhelmed, but I could tell that he knew he was being given a gift he could trust. It was about their hearts joining. It was clear that their hearts were on the verge of joining into some remarkable commitment that neither of them had experienced before. I don’t know if he saw the energy, too, but I certainly felt it and Pat seemed grateful because she knew. Her heart was ready to give him whatever she possibly could. For Bill, it was like asking a person to step off the curb blindly, knowing that rush-hour traffic was about to begin, yet also knowing the danger he felt was his own fear and that he would somehow be okay.[7]"

About the time Bill and Pat were becoming better acquainted, he met Carlagaye Olson. They became close friends and their Thursday “play-days” with Jules were noted earlier in terms of the healing Bill often seemed to precipitate. Bill and Carlagaye occasionally got together on weekends, when her husband Steve also joined them. When Catherine Prescott moved to town in 1984, she and Bill also became very close. At first, he saw her regularly in her professional therapeutic role, but that ultimately morphed into a more personal relationship, as well. Bill’s other meaningful relationships created a win/win situation, as Pat also cherished having her own space."

msgid "Those of us from out of town also maintained our friendships with Bill. He and I got together on my visits to Tiburon as well as periodically talking on the phone. His original core group in Tiburon remained central to his life in California, and his capacity to genuinely care for many individuals at the same time was very deep and remained to the end of his life. Bill could be with a person, in love, rather than being “in love” with a person, and each relationship seemed to foster another important aspect of his self-discovery."

msgid "As Pat and Bill began their fourth year sharing an apartment, both were often gone. In 1985, Pat started traveling to do research for the book she co-authored with Sherry Anderson, The Feminine Face of God, and ultimately moved into her own apartment in January 1986.[9] Bill was spending perhaps a third of his time in La Jolla, visiting there from 1982–1986 on an increasingly regular basis. Several months after they moved in together, Bill and Pat had gone to La Jolla, and after that Bill made extended visits, sometimes with Pat and sometimes alone. They had discovered a quiet, well-run motel, and either he or they stayed in the same room on each trip. He loved the greater ease of the southern California lifestyle and established a pattern of going there for at least three weeks, then returning to Tiburon. After several weeks, he started to feel a bit lonely and less energized, so he would head back south. He talked about vacillating between Tiburon and La Jolla, or more humorously, teetering away from Tiburon and leaning toward La Jolla. Clearly, something was drawing him there. It would be the last venue for his healing, representing a major breakthrough—an outward sign of another significant step in his evolution."

msgid "Robert Rosenthal recalled, “I think the next important transition for Bill was when it became clear that the relationship with Pat was not going to work out. From the way I understood it, Bill really wasn’t capable of a full sexual relationship with a woman. And so the relationship, as close as it was, was always left incomplete—a halfway relationship. Celibacy may have worked okay for him, but probably not for her.”[10] From Pat’s perspective on their time together, “We were like family, but not sisterly-brotherly, and we were partners, but not in the traditional sense of the word. To this day, I don’t know how to describe our relationship.”[11] She also told me, “I know it was hugely and immensely important; I would say that both our lives were significantly enriched, but I couldn’t give specifics.”[12]"

[Jerry was California born and bred and attended medical school at Stanford.] But Pat, Jules, Frances, Roger, and Judy shared his same worldview. That was the unconscious part of Bill’s ego in the beginning. In other words, he just presumed everyone would love Mozart and opera; that was a given or a fact.

Many echoed Hugh’s and Gayle’s comments, recognizing the heavy intellectual emphasis in Tiburon, his attempts to escape it, and his inability to take his next step until he was out of that environment entirely. In his own way, he was dissociating himself from normal rules of behavior, of self- and other kinds of evaluation. He had told his stories long enough and had chosen not to pursue a more public or authoritative role with the Course, nor a more conventional, professional career. In terms of an outward focus, he had done what he came to do. Also, Roger Walsh felt that part of the pull to La Jolla was to be with people, primarily the Lucketts, who solely devoted themselves to practicing ACIM.

msgid "In October 1986, Bill moved permanently to La Jolla. He had released much in Tiburon and done a marvelous job, as Frances Vaughan stated earlier, of learning to “take up no space,” inserting virtually no “personality noise.” However, not wanting to be egocentric can sometimes be a cover for emotional repression; he retained some old inhibitions and defense patterns when it came to self-expression. La Jolla was about sorting this out so he could more easily express his loving, gracious energy without reservation. He knew, as did those close to him, that the healing uniquely possible through his friends in southern California would be the major focus of the rest of his life. Forgiveness was still “job one.”"

The Lucketts served as Bill’s gateway to the joyous part of himself, because they were certifiably the most lighthearted of his companions. The label applied to them was “wild and carefree,” and almost literally arm in arm, the three of them traveled the last part of Bill’s path together."

A local friend found a condo for him, and Jules and Carlagaye moved his possessions and set things up there.

As you know, Bill possessed a quiet but intense magnetism that impressed and attracted women as well as men. He was uniformly cordial and warm to men, women, straight, or gay. He was not at ease with children or loudmouths. He was a celebrity in the gay male community, because of what he had accomplished in life. He did not try to impress or boast regardless of who he was introduced to. That was part of his unique charm. When we were with Bill and a male friend on a date, going to the theatre, the circus, or dinner, he was always very attentive and super concerned that his escort was treated well and had a good time. Bill had many gay friends but few, what we would call today, close relationships. His past lovers as well as casual friends were loyal and respectful right to the end.

Some visiting students of another ACIM teacher were distressed at what they considered a lack of respect for the sacred book.

I stopped the action, we held hands in a circle, asking the Holy Spirit to guide us, and after fifteen minutes of meditation, addressed the issue specifically in ACIM terms. We had a great discussion covering ego, judgment, fear, true vision, equal treatment of both sexes, and our true nature. At the end of that discussion, a young lady said, “If ‘I am not a body. I am free’ [one of the workbook lessons], what can a mere strip of cloth mean to me?” We then took a vote and decided that if, in the privacy of our meetings, any woman wished to be topless like the men, she could, but it was not required.

Out of this stimulating mix, no one ever questioned the early days’ practice of some girls going topless. In the 2,160 consecutive meetings with thousands of participants, not allowing smoking was a much larger issue.[22]"

In addition, Bill attended a number of other ACIM groups in the area and made a host of new friends in the process. He was presented with other opportunities for friendly outreach beyond the Course community. How could it be otherwise with Jack and Layle as guides? They took him everywhere. Almost every night they went to restaurants, movies, dinners, and entertainment of every conceivable kind. Jack commented on his preferences:"

Under no circumstances would he attend sci-fi, action, war, western, or vampire flicks, or stupid comedies. His favorite movie was Amadeus, which he viewed several times. We had season tickets to most live-theater houses. Bill liked the theater but had hard and fast rules about going. He insisted on an aisle seat and the play had to have an intermission (he opined that having no intermission meant the play was no good and everyone would leave if given a chance). In addition to opera and classical concerts, Bill also loved the circus, ice shows, and jazz concerts. We all had annual tickets to Sea World and often attended their night spectacles."

He read the Course daily, usually with me, and that was it.[23]"

Layle tended to engage with the wait staff, and following her lead, Bill started talking with them more and thoroughly enjoyed becoming acquainted with them. At his favorite places, the staff began to call him by name, and he would chat away with them. Pretty soon word went out that he was available for socializing and that the best venue for this was to invite him to breakfast. I can personally attest to his greater participation, because my husband and I went many places with him on our last visit to La Jolla, and he was well known at all the restaurants we visited."

We all came together and I had everyone hold hands. This is a nightclub, mind you! We all said a prayer, asking that everybody who was going to be on the stage that night would provide healing for everyone in the audience, that they would heal something in us that we didn’t understand or had rejected. And they all joined in, very willingly. It was not inappropriate at all, and Bill said, “You know, one of the things I have learned from being with you, Jack, is that the spiritual movement is happening everywhere if you take it with you, if you let the light shine.”[24]"

He caught it. Some people are full of religiosity and they fully approve of everything that seems to fall within their scope of standards, but are certain that anything that falls outside that scope has some evil attached to it.

Also, around Bill’s birthday in 1988, a handsome young sailor came to the Garden. They struck up an instant relationship, one so close that Billy actually acceded to driving up to Los Angeles with this guy in his red Jeep just for lunch! Can you imagine him so loose?

Late one night as the three of them were returning from the theater, Bill, out of the blue, started to sing parodies about the Course, changing the lyrics of the first lines of well-known songs. Jack also knew a lot of music, so he chimed in immediately with the next line. They alternated singing these lines from songs, creating an abbreviated, funny version of the Course history. For fifteen minutes, they invented hilarious new words, feeding off each other’s creativity. Jack said Bill got so tickled and laughed so hard, it was just wonderful, another great release for him. Bill had made up some musical parodies with Helen in New York, but this was the expanded version and yet another marker of his disappearing barriers and inhibitions. Jack referred to his time in LaJolla as “an out-reaching, people-oriented, heart-opening experiential phase. To his credit he participted with verve and charm.”[27]"

For several nonstop days, we attended ACIM Garden meetings with him, a daily routine, and it was great seeing him in his new “natural habitat.” We went to some of his favorite haunts, spent much time at his home, walked through the nearby park, and accompanied him to the first public viewing of the video, The Story of A Course In Miracles; it was scheduled, “by coincidence” for its premiere one evening while we were there. He was a bit nervous about everyone else watching him on film while he, too, watched but it seemed a relatively minor issue. This video documents the history of A Course In Miracles with Bill’s firsthand narration and skillful use of pictures of Helen, including excerpts read from her diaries. It was an unexpected treat for Bob and me to observe Bill watching himself on screen. Afterward, he asked for feedback about several aspects of the production, and we assured him that both the video and his presentation were right on. It was a delight to be with him as he jumped another hurdle about being publicly noticed. I thought he had grown so much and was more casual, relaxed, and open than ever before. He was more expressive generally and seemed very happy. In the year following our visit, we spoke periodically on the phone, and I was deeply satisfied to know that all was right with his world and getting better all the time."

She was recently widowed and they rekindled their old friendship.

Much of his humor stemmed from recognizing fear’s lack of substance and the absurdity of taking ourselves so seriously. “This is the way salvation works. As you step back, the light in you steps forward and encompasses the world. It heralds not the end of sin in punishment and death. In lightness and in laughter is sin gone, because its quaint absurdity is seen.

He reached the point where there was little more for him to say, because knowing was so deeply embedded in his psyche. He had allowed grievances and old habit patterns to be dissolved, and now experienced the truth of his being. Talk would only trivialize it.

My favorite mantra is, “When all else fails, tell the truth,” and Bill now adopted this fully. We have been conditioned to do everything else but that, having learned our manipulating and negotiating skills at a very early age. As with all of us, Bill’s imprisonment began in childhood; with each grievance he collected, another imaginary bar was installed, creating the subjective experience of an unshared, lonely prison. But with each choice to change his mind, a bar vanished, and he felt more powerful, integrated, secure, confident, and able to access his inborn wisdom. He was in charge of the prison doors and could use his talents to gain his freedom."

Throughout his adult life he had irregular heartbeat episodes that he basically ignored; he was very casual about body-related issues except for the carotid artery blockage in 1981, which demanded attention and, ultimately, two surgeries. Jack noted Bill’s flu-like symptoms and, aware of his chronic heart condition, asked if his affairs were in order and/or if he would like help with his will or other related paperwork.

About the time people would be reading their program notes, some ladies came through; if you were at a ballgame you would say they were hotdog and beer hawkers. But these were very straight, ethereal-looking, ballerina-type ladies and they were handing out chocolate sundaes, for which Bill had a particular fondness. Not only were there chocolate sundaes, but those coffee-crunch things you could put on top, which he also loved. I thought this was very strange, but they were very good and I noticed that he was eating his. About the time you would expect the overture to begin, Bill stood up from his chair, turned around to face us, and said, “I have come full circle in my life. All the things that I didn’t understand, all the things I was afraid to say, I now want to share with you.” He proceeded to give the most exquisite, simple, eloquent speech that moved absolutely everybody. Knowing how he hated to speak in public and the anxiety it caused him, the relaxation with which he delivered this truth of his life was an incredible thing to behold. When he was finished, Frances, Judy, Calvin, and I looked at each other and said we thought we knew Bill, but this was a totally new dimension of this person that we all loved so much. Nobody applauded but when he finished, everybody stood up with tears running down their cheeks. The house was filled and people started to gather in small clumps or groups and began to tell each other the truth of their lives with the same utter defenselessness, vulnerability, and trust that he had exhibited when he stood and talked with us. I saw Bill beaming down on absolutely everyone at what he had set in motion. That was the end of the dream. The next morning when I awakened, I was in a joyful state. I knew that Bill had come to something in his life that was totally freeing, absolutely new, and the achievement of a lifetime. Naturally, my ego got involved and wondered if it was my own projection, so I waited eagerly for his next visit to share the dream with him, to see for myself whether or not it was true. As we now know, it was a dream but it was also true.[6]"

At first, they thought it would be only a few pages long, but as it continued to unfold, it became clear it was a much longer work. Now, four decades later, we can say offhandedly, “Oh yes, the Course consists of a text, a workbook, and teacher’s manual,” but they had no way of knowing that early on. When they inquired, the inner Voice told them they would recognize the end of dictation (of the text) when they heard the word Amen. I am consistently moved to tears, imagining that October morning in 1968, when Helen slowly read the words, “And now we say Amen,” the first sentence in the final paragraph of the text."

Those who knew and loved him during the California chapter of his life watched his steady transformation unfold—sometimes barely perceptible, sometimes in sudden leaps, occasionally with some discomfort, but always modestly—as his initial small willingness to practice forgiveness grew into a serious commitment. Once he made that commitment to practice complete forgiveness, he never really wavered. Everyone noticed the steady dissolution of his ego, that process markedly accelerating after he moved to La Jolla. His prayers for help, indeed, were granted, and one day Bill simply woke up, walked out of “prison,” and declared his own independence on July 4, 1988. No one who knew him believed the date was a coincidence; in retrospect, everyone laughed about it, affirming the perfection of his last few days. Bill, who so loved to play with words, was playing with dates. In the end, all grievances were healed and “flexi-Bill” was free."

With uncharacteristic fervor, Bill insisted that they have dinner with Jerry the night of the third. Since she planned to leave for Hawaii the next day, she responded, “No, it’s not worth it, Bill; I’ll see you when I get back.” In retrospect, she found it amazing that he kept saying, “No, no, I have to see you before you go!” She agreed to dinner, somewhat reluctantly, because she had an early morning departure and many last-minute chores still to do."

Spending that much time with Bill was such a treat for him. “Bill was in a very playful, joyful mood, very light. I never saw him so exuberant; his humor was amazing. He was walking very lightly and kind of playing. You know how he liked to play on words. I was really happy to see him lighter, not taking life seriously.

Jerry picked him up at the airport to bring him to our house for lunch, which I had ready about 12:30, expecting them by 1:00 p.m. It passed, then 1:30, 2:00; they weren’t there and I was getting a little miffed! This was before cell phones. Finally, around 3:00 they walked in and what I saw was so unexpected. Jerry looked kind of sheepish and Bill was smiling as if he were onstage. He was lifting up his arms in the air with grace—I never thought of Bill as a graceful person—and doing a little jig as he walked in the door. Then he kissed me and said, “You won’t believe what happened, you won’t believe what happened!” I said, “What?” still a little miffed. He said, “We had terrible, terrible traffic and Jerry didn’t get angry once!” I looked at Jerry and he sort of shrugged, smiling his little embarrassed smile because that remark meant that he usually did get annoyed at traffic. But Bill felt something had happened and was commenting on the difference, “We had such a wonderful talk, a really wonderful connection.” He was very much aware that it was different with Jerry, and oh, my goodness, he was dancing, literally dancing into our house![10]"

It was a very different Bill. He was just happy, but the happiness was not “good mood” happiness, rather a joy that was radiating through the body. His spirit was transcendent. Watching him as I served him lunch (there was the watcher part and the doer part of me), the watcher thought something strange was going on here. I wondered if he was on something, thinking some medication had him stoned. I asked him what he was taking these days and he laughed, saying, “No, no, I’m just feeling so good, so free, so complete!” When I asked if he meant “relationship complete,” he answered that he was. So, playing the role of the sister, I started quizzing him about them, beginning with Ken. Bill said he had spoken with Ken a few months before, telling him that anything he had ever held against him was his own misperception and how terribly sorry he was. He was honest with Ken about the times he had resented him, his judgments about him, and his resistance to being friends with him.

The whole idea of Bill dying right then and there—my mind raced thinking about his being alone, all that one thinks when something like that happens. If I had come out three minutes earlier, could I have saved him? But the doctor was in total control, and I’ll never forget his kindness. He wanted to know what medicines he might have been on, so I ran to the house, brought out his shaving kit, and he started going through it while still holding Bill. The paramedics wanted to give him oxygen, but the doctor said he was already gone, dead before his head hit the road.

If we change just a few details, we recognize our own journey in his and can see that his answers are also ours. It is true that Bill possessed talents and assets that many of us don’t have, making many facets of his life easier than for most. However, those assets of privilege were paired with challenges that would have broken the spirits of many. He was an amazing human being, but he was human. As I am sure he would earnestly want to convey, the traits he cultivated, the ones that led him home, are well within everyone’s reach: a daily, steadfast determination to let go of conflict—the ego’s sustenance—and willingness to make peace of mind the primary goal for each encounter. We need his human example to see that we’re not asked to sacrifice in practicing forgiveness. His life demonstrates that it is worth it. We do need to relinquish our defenses, attachments, and valueless investments, though not necessarily our worldly possessions if they aid with our gifts of service. We cherish our grievances rather than each other, as if they were precious heirlooms, but we can change our minds. If Bill had a profound mission, so do we.

In every era, various seers and masters have comprehended the hypnotized state of the human condition and offered Truth as its remedy, but this modern group of pioneers represents a grassroots movement.

msgstr ""

#: paragraph:1307
msgid "Years one to seven: Self-sufficient and relatively inactive, he was probably an “Internalizer” to whom ideas were real because he discovered he had a facility for abstract and symbolic reasoning. As a consequence, he would have been relatively passive, preferring to withdraw into an inner world to think rather than do and to shun the concrete, the specific,. and the practical. His emotions would also have been directed inward. Primarily self-contained, he would have sought major psychological satisfactions in the privacy of his own experiences."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:1308
msgid "Nevertheless, he was probably sensitive to a wide range of confusing subtleties, signals, and stimuli around him. Working from diffused impressions, his intuition and active imagination would have been quick to grasp the “atmosphere” of a new situation. Thus, his process for finding meaning would have been “Flexible,” perceiving his world in shades of gray, never completely logical or black and white. His major problem was probably his need to restrict his awareness and responses sufficiently to enable him to concentrate and organize his experiences with the external world. Learning new activities might have been frustratingly slow for him because he first needed to understand the meaning and purpose of a task or a situation. That is to say, he probably was not inclined to rote learning but preferred trial and error."

msgid "Although he was externally passive and demanded little attention, he was highly “Adaptive” socially. Blessed with a chameleon-like personality as a child, he could mask his confusion and true feelings by his ability to play any congenial role called for by the occasion. By the age of seven, he should have discovered that he could be “all things to all people.” Despite his surface social warmth, his confusion and his fantasies may have fostered caution, imaginary playmates, and terrors such as nightmares, hypochondria, and inner tensions that he could mask by a seeming empathy for others, even though he would not often understand them."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:1310
msgid "Years eight to fourteen: Forced to associate with older children, he must have learned how to exploit his continuing social adaptivity, his charm and empathy, to find practical application of idealistic impulses with adroit creativity and imagination. Thanks in part to his “coming out” (after years of seclusion) into society, he probably was experientially curious, enjoying a wide diversity of sensual stimulation, including responsibility, authority, and carefully controlled heterosexual activity in school. Inclined to enthusiasm and advocacy, he would have enjoyed argument, persuasion, and discussion, usually being tolerant while he tried to make classmates understand and accept his own ideas and beliefs."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:1311
msgid "On the other hand, when he recognized that another person could not or would not accept his beliefs, he could have been quite unfeeling in the way he rejected or rebuffed them. Although attracted to group feelings, he would have even abandoned a group if it failed to live up to his ideals. In other words, instead of adjusting to a group’s identity, armed with the courage of his convictions and a low tolerance for disillusionment, he would have searched for other people who might fulfill his unchanging values, ideals, and expectations. Setting very high standards, by the time he entered high school he had probably become something of a social snob, situation-oriented, role versatile, and fickle in his choice of friends."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:1312
msgid "Years fifteen to twenty-one: In sum, at the intellectual level he ended his development poised between “humanitarian, striving for the common good, loyal, sincere, and persevering” and “needing external activity but developing relationships that were more likely to be superficial than deeply involved.” . . . He learned to control his childhood tendency toward warm empathy and excessive personal involvement."
msgstr ""

#: paragraph:1313
msgid "With respect to his social behavior, his school years must have fostered a highly developed social conscience. In consequence, he shifted from his role as a social chameleon to a stronger sense of responsibility, with a well-defined set of personal values and greater concern about the impression he was making. In conventional social relations, he would have been impatient with indifference, incompetence, lassitude, and irresponsibility. Instead, he had committed himself to understanding and bringing improvement and progress to conventional methods, systems, and society. Indeed, his zeal for improving the world probably made it difficult for him to relax."

msgid "It is a simple fact that this book is possible only because of extensive and heartfelt input from many of Bill’s closest friends, and to them I am grateful beyond measure. Although I already possessed many documents and much information about Bill, the Foundation for Inner Peace kindly made their archives available to fill in the gaps. Without Judy and Whit Whitson, who along with Bob Skutch and Kenneth Wapnick are the centers of the original ACIM family, it would be a decidedly less complete work. They have generously shared their time, their memories of Bill, and their enthusiasm for the project. Nor would it have come together without the excellent suggestions and expertise of my dear, lifelong friend and professional editor, Sarah Whalen-Kraft. She has skillfully assisted in turning my memories poured out on paper and my transcribed conversations with more than thirty people into a more graceful document. I extend sincere thanks also to Julie Ruffo, who provided specialized editorial services and assisted with publishing decisions. My treasured friend, Alice MacMahon, served as reader, unofficial editor, and cheerleader for the project. So too, my sons Greg and Nelson were wholeheartedly in favor of my writing Bill’s story and encouraged me to persevere when the mountain of details and information seemed daunting. My fun-loving friend, Judie Chiappone, who definitely never forgets to laugh, took the back cover picture. Last but certainly not least, Cathy Sanders and Kathryn Van Aernum brought their extensive graphic design experience and good will to the layout design and cover respectively."
